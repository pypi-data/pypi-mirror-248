## DEV

I use python-3.10.9 for development, please use python <= 3.10. 

And it is recommended to use python virtual environment to avoid some unnecessary problems.

Here is my developing steps:

```shell
# python=3.10.9
git clone https://github.com/akynazh/jvav.git
cd jvav
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

And then you can enjoy coding! Remember to write or run test cases in `tests/test.py`.
Please make sure the test is okay before submitting your code~

## TODO

The following are some functions to be implemented, and I look forward to your contribution~ 

- [ ] cache the successful query results locally
- [x] support javdb.com (Thanks: [@Steven-Fake](https://github.com/Steven-Fake))
- [ ] support db.msin.jp
- [ ] support JavDbUtil in cmd
- [ ] support SgpUtil in cmd
- [ ] support JavDbUtil in cmd
