import os

__all__ = (
    "get_version",
    # Private:
    #  '_version_from_tags',
)

# This empty version value will be populated temporarily during poetry-build
# by poetry-dynamic-versioning.
# - Consequently, __version__ remains empty when installed in 'editable' mode
#   and accessed at runtime. So query get_version() instead, which uses
#   importlib to fetch the package version from when it was installed.
__version__ = "1.0.5"

# - Note a few subtle differences between importlib and setuptools_scm:
#   - importlib.metadata.version returns the package version that was
#       installed, which might include Git tags, but the version is static
#       and won't track any repo changes.
#   - setuptools_scm, on the other hand, uses the latest commit to format
#       the version.
# - For example, let's say a repo has 27 commits and no version tag,
#   then you might see these versions:
#     - importlib:      0.0.0.post27.dev0+7c3df03 ("0.0.0" from pyproject.toml)
#     - setuptools_scm: 0.1.dev27+g7c3df03.d20231114 (starting itself at "0.1")
#   - Note that both versions indicate the distance (27) since the last
#     version (or since the first commit, in this case), and each version
#     contains the Git ref (7c3df03) of the latest commit.
#   - Now let's suppose you add 5 commits, Now you might see the versions:
#     - importlib:      0.0.0.post27.dev0+7c3df03 (unchanged)
#     - setuptools_scm: 0.1.dev32+g187abdc.d20231114 (changed)
#     As mentioned, importlib's version is still the unchanged package
#     version, whereas setuptools_scm indicates the new distance (32)
#     and a different Git ref (187abdc).
