              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

# What is AIJack?

AIJack is an easy-to-use open-source simulation tool for testing the security of your AI system against hijackers. It provides advanced security techniques like *Differential Privacy*, *Homomorphic Encryption*, *K-anonymity* and *Federated Learning* to guarantee protection for your AI. With AIJack, you can test and simulate defenses against various attacks such as *Poisoning*, *Model Inversion*, *Backdoor*, and *Free-Rider*. We support more than 30 state-of-the-art methods. For more information, check our [documentation](https://koukyosyumei.github.io/AIJack/) and start securing your AI today with AIJack.

# Installation

You can install AIJack with `pip`. AIJack requires Boost and pybind11.

```
apt install -y libboost-all-dev
pip install -U pip
pip install "pybind11[global]"

pip install aijack
```

If you want to use the latest-version, you can directly install from GitHub.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/Koukyosyumei/AIJack
```

We also provide [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).


# Quick Start

We briefly introduce the overview of AIJack.

## Features

-   All-around abilities for both attack & defense
-   PyTorch-friendly design
-   Compatible with scikit-learn
-   Fast Implementation with C++ backend
-   MPI-Backend for Federated Learning
-   Extensible modular APIs

## Basic Interface

### Python API

For standard machine learning algorithms, AIJack allows you to simulate attacks against machine learning models with `Attacker` APIs. AIJack mainly supports PyTorch or sklearn models.

```Python
# abstract code

attacker = Attacker(target_model)
result = attacker.attack()
```

For instance, we can implement Poisoning Attack against SVM implemented with sklearn as follows.

```Python
from aijack . attack import Poison_attack_sklearn

attacker = Poison_attack_sklearn (clf , X_train , y_train)
malicious_data , log = attacker.attack(initial_data , 1, X_valid , y_valid)
```

For distributed learning such as Federated Learning and Split Learning, AIJack offers four basic APIs: `Client`, `Server`, `API`, and `Manager`. `Client` and `Server` represent each client and server within each distributed learning scheme. You can execute training by registering the clients and servers to `API` and running it. `Manager` gives additional abilities such as attack, defense, or parallel computing to `Client`, `Server` or `API` via `attach` method.

```Python
# abstract code

client = [Client(), Client()]
server = Server()
api = API(client, server)
api.run() # execute training

c_manager = ClientManagerForAdditionalAbility(...)
s_manager = ServerManagerForAdditionalAbility(...)
ExtendedClient = c_manager.attach(Client)
ExtendedServer = c_manager.attach(Server)

extended_client = [ExtendedClient(...), ExtendedClient(...)]
extended_server = ExtendedServer(...)
api = API(extended_client, extended_server)
api.run() # execute training
```

For example, the bellow code implements the scenario where the server in Federated Learning tries to steal the training data with gradient-based model inversion attack.

```Python
from aijack.collaborative.fedavg import FedAVGAPI, FedAVGClient, FedAVGServer
from aijack.attack.inversion import GradientInversionAttackServerManager

manager = GradientInversionAttackServerManager(input_shape)
FedAVGServerAttacker = manager.attach(FedAVGServer)

clients = [FedAVGClient(model_1), FedAVGClient(model_2)]
server = FedAVGServerAttacker(clients, model_3)

api = FedAVGAPI(server, clients, criterion, optimizers, dataloaders)
api.run()
```

### AIValut: A simple DBMS for debugging ML Models

We also provide a simple DBMS named `AIValut` designed specifically for SQL-based algorithms. AIValut currently supports Rain, a SQL-based debugging system for ML models. In the future, we have plans to integrate additional advanced features from AIJack, including K-Anonymity, Homomorphic Encryption, and Differential Privacy. 

AIValut has its own storage engine and query parser, and you can train and debug ML models with SQL-like queries. For example, the `Complaint` query automatically removes problematic records given the specified constraint.

```sql
# We train an ML model to classify whether each customer will go bankrupt or not based on their age and debt.
# We want the trained model to classify the customer as positive when he/she has more debt than or equal to 100.
# The 10th record seems problematic for the above constraint.
>>Select * From bankrupt
id age debt y
1 40 0 0
2 21 10 0
3 22 10 0
4 32 30 0
5 44 50 1
6 30 100 1
7 63 310 1
8 53 420 1
9 39 530 1
10 49 1000 0

# Train Logistic Regression with the number of iterations of 100 and the learning rate of 1.
# The name of the target feature is `y`, and we use all other features as training data.
>>Logreg lrmodel id y 100 1 From Select * From bankrupt
Trained Parameters:
 (0) : 2.771564
 (1) : -0.236504
 (2) : 0.967139
AUC: 0.520000
Prediction on the training data is stored at `prediction_on_training_data_lrmodel`

# Remove one record so that the model will predict `positive (class 1)` for the samples with `debt` greater or equal to 100.
>>Complaint comp Shouldbe 1 Remove 1 Against Logreg lrmodel id y 100 1 From Select * From bankrupt Where debt Geq 100
Fixed Parameters:
 (0) : -4.765492
 (1) : 8.747224
 (2) : 0.744146
AUC: 1.000000
Prediction on the fixed training data is stored at `prediction_on_training_data_comp_lrmodel`
```
