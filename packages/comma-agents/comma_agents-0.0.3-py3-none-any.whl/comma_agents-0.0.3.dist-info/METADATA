# Welcome to Comma Agents! 🌟

Hello and welcome to the Comma Agents community! We're absolutely delighted to have you here. Comma Agents is all about empowering coders like you to create and manage automated agents with ease and efficiency. Our platform is designed to make your journey into the world of automated language learning models (LLMs) both enjoyable and productive. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, we're here to support your creative coding endeavors every step of the way!

## Installation Guide 🛠️

Getting started with Comma Agents is a breeze! Here's how you can get everything set up:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install comma-agents
   ```
3. Voilà! You're all set to begin your adventure with Comma Agents.

Head over to the documentation if you want to learn more about examples and docs [Comma Agents Documentation](https://commaagents.com/)

## Quick Start! 🔥

Here's a simple script to kick things off with a local LLaMa model:

```python
from comma_agents.agents.external import LLaMaAgent

# Creating an example agent
example_agent = LLaMaAgent(
    name="Example Agent",
    llama_config={
        "model_path": "{local_model_path}",
    }
)

# Let's see what our agent has to say!
example_agent.call("Hello! How are you doing today LLM?")
```

Want to type in the questions? Try a UserAgent with `require_input=True` and a sequential flow!

```python
from comma_agents.agents import UserAgent
from comma_agents.flows import SequentialFlow

# Setting up a sequential flow
flow = SequentialFlow(
    flow_name="Example Flow",
    flows=[
        UserAgent(
            name="User",
            require_input=True
        ),
        example_agent
    ]
)

# Time to run our flow!
flow.run_flow()
```
