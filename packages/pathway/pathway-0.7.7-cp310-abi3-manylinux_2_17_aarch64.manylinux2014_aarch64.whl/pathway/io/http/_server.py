    Runs a lightweight HTTP server and inputs a collection from the HTTP endpoint,
    configured by the parameters of this method.

    On the output, the method provides a table and a callable, which needs to accept
    the result table of the computation, which entries will be tracked and put into
    respective request's responses.

    Args:
        host: TCP/IP host or a sequence of hosts for the created endpoint;
        port: port for the created endpoint;
        route: route which will be listened to by the web server;
        schema: schema of the resulting table;
        autocommit_duration_ms: the maximum time between two commits. Every
          autocommit_duration_ms milliseconds, the updates received by the connector are
          committed and pushed into Pathway's computation graph;
        keep_queries: whether to keep queries after processing; defaults to False. [deprecated]
        delete_completed_queries: whether to send a deletion entry after the query is processed.
          Allows to remove it from the system if it is stored by operators such as ``join`` or ``groupby``;

    Returns:
        table: the table read;
        response_writer: a callable, where the result table should be provided.
