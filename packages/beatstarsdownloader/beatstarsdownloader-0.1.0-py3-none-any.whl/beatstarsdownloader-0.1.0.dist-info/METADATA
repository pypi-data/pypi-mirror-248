# BeatStarsDownloader

Python script for downloading all tracks from a beatstars artist track page. 
It functions as a BeatStars downloader to mp3.

Fork from [pyscrapetrain](https://github.com/tim-morriss/pyscrapeTrain).

# Setup
There are two ways to run this tool, either using the pip package or manuall installing the tool.

Pip package method is preferred, only resort to using the manual install if you're having issues.
## Pip Package

Install the pip package, using this command:

```bash
pip install beatstarsdownloader
```

## Manual install
First clone this repo, then install the `requirements.txt` file by using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the tool using this command:

```bash
python main.py
```

*For the rest of the readme, make sure to swap out the `beatstarsdownloader` command for `python main.py`.*

# How to use:
## Terminal interface
Feel free to use the built in terminal interface to download tracks from a single URL / artist name:

```bash
beatstarsdownloader
```

## CLI interface

**When inputting a url make sure to use the artist's /tracks page.**

**For example: `https://www.beatstars.com/lovbug/tracks`**

----

To download all the tracks from a profile run the following command:

```bash
beatstarsdownloader <beatstars tracks url or artist name>
```

For example: 
```bash
beatstarsdownloader https://www.beatstars.com/lovbug/tracks
```
OR
```bash
beatstarsdownloader lovbug
```

Tracks are downloaded to a `beatstarsDownloader/artist` folder in your home directory. 
## Changing folder
To change download folder use the `-d` flag:
```bash
beatstarsdownloader <beatstars-url> -d /path/to/folder
```

Which will create a `beatstarsDownloader/artist` folder under the path specified.
For example:
```bash
beatstarsdownloader https://www.beatstars.com/lovbug/tracks -d /Users/user/Documents
```
Will create the following folder `/Users/user/Documents/beatstarsDownloader/lovbug`.

## Adding custom album
You might want to listen to the playlist of tracks you just downloaded 
so the script supports a custom album ID3 tag to allow you to sort in your media library.

Use the `-a` tag to assign a custom album name.

For example:
```bash
beatstarsdownloader https://www.beatstars.com/lovbug/tracks -a "bs lovbug"
```

Which gives:

## Supplying a list of URLs

If you want to scrape multiple beatstars pages then you can point a .txt file 
with each url you want to scrape on a new line.

For this use-case simply specify the filepath instead of a url.

For example:
```bash
beatstarsdownloader example_url_list.txt
```

Example list of urls:
