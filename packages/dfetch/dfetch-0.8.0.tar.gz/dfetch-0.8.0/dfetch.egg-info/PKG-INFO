**DFetch can manage dependencies**

We needed a dependency manager that was flexible enough to retrieve dependencies as plain text
from various sources. `svn externals`, `git submodules` and `git subtrees` solve a similar
problem, but not in a VCS agnostic way or completely user friendly way.
We want self-contained code repositories without any hassle for end-users.
Dfetch must promote upstreaming changes, but allow for local customizations.
The problem is described thoroughly [here](https://embeddedartistry.com/blog/2020/06/22/qa-on-managing-external-dependencies/) and sometimes
is also known as [*vendoring*](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26217488/what-is-vendoring).

Other tools that do similar things are ``Zephyr's West``, ``CMake ExternalProject`` and other meta tools.
See [alternatives](https://dfetch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/alternatives.html) for a complete list.
