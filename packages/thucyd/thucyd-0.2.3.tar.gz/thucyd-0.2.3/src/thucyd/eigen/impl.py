    'arcsin' method returns angles that span [-pi/2, pi/2]. The preferred method
    is 'arctanz2' and 'arcsin' may be deprecated in the future.

    Parameters
    ----------
    V: np.ndarray
        Eigenvector matrix with columns vectors
    E: np.ndarray
        Eigenvalue vector whose entries are associated to the columns of V
    method: bool (default: False)

    1. The columns of `Vor` are ordered such that their associated eigenvalues
       are sorted in descending order of absolute value. That the absolute
       value is taken on the eigenvalues is to treat the general case of an
       input Hermitian matrix. For data analysis, SVD yields a positive
       (semi)definite eigensystem, so negative eigenvalues are not attained.

    2. The entries of `Eor` are ordered in descending absolute value
       of the input eigenvalue vector `E`.

    """
    The call `orient_eigenvectors` consumes an eigenvector matrix `V` that is
    not necessarily oriented and returns `Vor`, its oriented counterpart.
    The `orient_eigenvectors` call also returns `angles_matrix`.

    This function consumes `angles_matrix` (instead of `V`) to produce `Vor`,
    the oriented eigenvector matrix.

    Recall that

    (1)    Vor = V S = R

    where `S` is a diagonal matrix with +/- 1 entries, and `R` is a rotation
    matrix. `orient_eigenvectors` computes `V S` while this function computes
    `R`.

    For a constituent basis I(n), the identity matrix, `R` rotates `I` into
    `Vor`,

    (2)    Vor = R I.

    In this way we identify `R` with the rotation that brings `I` into align-
    ment with `Vor`.

    Rotation matrix `R` itself is a cascade of rotations, one for each eigen-
    vector,

    (3)    R = R_1 R_2 ... R_n .

    Moreover, rotation R_k is itself a cascade of elemental Givens rotations.
    In R^4, the R_1 rotation is

    (4)    R_1(theta_(1,2), theta_(1,3), theta_(1,4)) =
                R_(1,2)(theta_(1,2))
                    x R_(1,3)(theta_(1,3))
                        x R_(1,4)(theta_(1,4)).

    The angles are read from `angles_matrix` such that

              -                  -
              | 0  t12  t13  t14 |  <-- row for R_1
    ang_mtx = |    0    t23  t24 |  <-- row for R_2
              |    *    0    t34 |   ...
              |    *    *    0   |
              -                  -

    Parameters
    ----------
    angles_matrix: ndarray
        Upper-triangular (n x n) matrix of angles.
    kth_eigenvector: int
        Default value is None, otherwise a base(1) indicator of the eigenvector
        to rotate into its constituent axis.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        Resultant rotation matrix.

    Notes
    -----
    The full dimension of the space is inferred from the dimension of
    `angles_matrix`. Given a `full_dim`, the rotation matrix that corresponds
    to the kth eigenvector is constructed from elementary Givens rotations.
    In R^4, the rotation matrix for the 1st eigenvector is

    (1) R_1(theta_(1,2), theta_(1,3), theta_(1,4)) =
            R_(1,2)(theta_(1,2)) x R_(1,3)(theta_(1,3)) x R_(1,4)(theta_(1,4)).

    The rotation matrix for the full eigenbasis in R^4 is

    (2) R = R_1 R_2 R_3 R_4.
