    Ideal for testing the site locally on any machine without pressing Ctrl + F5 on browser on every change.
    Here's how it currently 'flows':
        1. The start_server() is invoked by run_process() # Runs a process
        2. This consequently also calls build_project() and generates a output directory, within the monitored directory, containing the built site.
        3. The HTTP web server is started
        4. Monitor provided directory for changes
        5. If a change is detected, process from 1. is restarted
        6. Consequently 2. - 3. is repeated, with the new changes reflected in a new browser tab.
        7. Repeat until a KeyboardInterrupt is received # Ctrl + C

    Note:
        Reference for watchfile's run_process: https://watchfiles.helpmanual.io/api/run_process/#watchfiles.run_process
        This does NOT hot-reload changes on the same browser tab that is open.
        That would require some client-side .JS code for communicating with this web server.

    Args:
        project_folder (str): The path to the rupantar project folder where the 'content' and 'notes' directories are located.
        config_file_name (str): The name of the configuration file. Defaults to config.yml if not explicitly provided.
        port (int): The port number to use for the web server. If the port is None or in the range 0-1024, a random port in the range 49152-65535 is used as default.
        interface_address (str): The network address to use for the web server. If the address is not valid, '127.0.0.1' i.e. localhost is used as default.
        open_url (bool): If True, opens the serving URL in a new tab of the default browser. Defaults to False.

    Raises:
        Exception: If any error starting the web server (or while serving the files...).
