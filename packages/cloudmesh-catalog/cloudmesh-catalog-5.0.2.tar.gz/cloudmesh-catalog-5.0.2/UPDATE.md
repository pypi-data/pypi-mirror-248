In this document we essentially try to manage a CHNAGELOG as well as plan for 
managing high level tasks so we organize contributions.

The weekly update is due every Monday midnight EST.

Bullet form updates are requested so we can assess deliverables and reports given 
to outside collaborators. We docuent in reverse chronological order per week with the latest week 
first. We organize things per week by topic. Any update reportable to NIST is prefixed with (NIST), each contributor 
should have at least one report on weekly basis to NIST.

Keep in mind:

* What have I done?
* What have I not achieved?
* What would I like to achieve next time?
* What should be reported to external collaborators (NIST)?

## Monday 28th Feb, 2022

* Organizing collaborator support

  * (NIST) Meeting time does not match up with NIST, e.g. one day after NIST meeting 
    is not workable for updates. Updates must be done Monday midnight.

  * (todo) Collaborators have set up environment 
    * (update?, python, gitbash, github client, pycharm, ...)

  * (todo) Overdue items
    * install software, learn github, earn multiprocessing, showcase FastAPI example
  
* Catalog Data

  * (todo) Some comments about somone shifting task and not doing AWS.
    * Need to add AWS as musch more important
    * Here the must haves: AWS, Azure, Google, Oracle

    * After these are done we can do others
    * Clarify what scraping means ... could be copy paste and then write prg 
    * around what you copied paste, but we need alwayd link from where you copied.
