### `Agent` Example
- Reliable Structure that provides LLMS autonomy
- Extremely Customizeable with stopping conditions, interactivity, dynamical temperature, loop intervals, and so much more
- Enterprise Grade + Production Grade: `Agent` is designed and optimized for automating real-world tasks at scale!

```python
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Import the OpenAIChat model and the Agent struct
from swarms.models import OpenAIChat
from swarms.structs import Agent

# Load the environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Get the API key from the environment
api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Initialize the language model
llm = OpenAIChat(
    temperature=0.5,
    model_name="gpt-4",
    openai_api_key=api_key,
    max_tokens=4000
)


## Initialize the workflow
agent = Agent(llm=llm, max_loops=1, autosave=True, dashboard=True)

# Run the workflow on a task
agent.run("Generate a 10,000 word blog on health and wellness.")



```

------

### `SequentialWorkflow`
- A Sequential swarm of autonomous agents where each agent's outputs are fed into the next agent
- Save and Restore Workflow states!
- Integrate Agent's with various LLMs and Multi-Modality Models

```python
import os 
from swarms.models import OpenAIChat
from swarms.structs import Agent
from swarms.structs.sequential_workflow import SequentialWorkflow
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

# Load the environment variables
api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")


# Initialize the language agent
llm = OpenAIChat(
    temperature=0.5,
    model_name="gpt-4",
    openai_api_key=api_key,
    max_tokens=4000
)


# Initialize the agent with the language agent
agent1 = Agent(llm=llm, max_loops=1)

# Create another agent for a different task
agent2 = Agent(llm=llm, max_loops=1)

# Create another agent for a different task
agent3 = Agent(llm=llm, max_loops=1)

# Create the workflow
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(max_loops=1)

# Add tasks to the workflow
workflow.add(
    agent1, "Generate a 10,000 word blog on health and wellness.", 
)

# Suppose the next task takes the output of the first task as input
workflow.add(
    agent2, "Summarize the generated blog",
)

# Run the workflow
workflow.run()

# Output the results
for task in workflow.tasks:
    print(f"Task: {task.description}, Result: {task.result}")


```

## `Multi Modal Autonomous Agents`
- Run the agent with multiple modalities useful for various real-world tasks in manufacturing, logistics, and health.

```python
# Description: This is an example of how to use the Agent class to run a multi-modal workflow
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from swarms.models.gpt4_vision_api import GPT4VisionAPI
from swarms.structs import Agent

# Load the environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Get the API key from the environment
api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Initialize the language model
llm = GPT4VisionAPI(
    openai_api_key=api_key,
    max_tokens=500,
)

# Initialize the task
task = (
    "Analyze this image of an assembly line and identify any issues such as"
    " misaligned parts, defects, or deviations from the standard assembly"
    " process. IF there is anything unsafe in the image, explain why it is"
    " unsafe and how it could be improved."
)
img = "assembly_line.jpg"

## Initialize the workflow
agent = Agent(
    llm=llm,
    max_loops="auto",
    autosave=True,
    dashboard=True,
    multi_modal=True
)

# Run the workflow on a task
agent.run(task=task, img=img)


```


### `OmniModalAgent`
- An agent that can understand any modality and conditionally generate any modality.

```python
from swarms.agents.omni_modal_agent import OmniModalAgent, OpenAIChat
from swarms.models import OpenAIChat
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

# Load the environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Get the API key from the environment
api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Initialize the language model
llm = OpenAIChat(
    temperature=0.5,
    model_name="gpt-4",
    openai_api_key=api_key,
)


agent = OmniModalAgent(llm)
agent.run("Generate a video of a swarm of fish and then make an image out of the video")
```
