      - Flash WLED to the ESP device: https://kno.wled.ge/basics/install-binary/
      - Ensure all WLED devices are powered on, and connected to your Wi-Fi.
      - Test you can access the WLED web interface from your PC. If so, then you're good to go!

#. **Install LedFx.**
      - After you have WLED installed on your ESP device, download: `LedFx.exe`_ and install LedFx.
      - For Mac and Linux `LedFx Builds`_, or see the `installation documentation`_ or `LedFx Guide`_.

      - If not, on the bottom click Home,  -> ``Scan for WLED devices`` button, or click on the big plus sign and ``Add Device`` to add them manually.
      - If they're still not showing up, make sure they're powered on and properly connected to your WiFi.

#. **Start using effects!**
      - Click on the device, select an effect eg ``scroll`` under Classic
