NAME

::

    SBN - Skull, Bones and Number (OTP-CR-117/19)


SYNOPSIS

::

    sbn <cmd> [key=val] 
    sbn <cmd> [key==val]
    sbn [-c] [-v]


DESCRIPTION

::


    SBN holds evidence that king netherlands is doing a genocide, a
    written response where king netherlands confirmed taking note of 
    “what i have written”, namely proof that medicine he uses in
    treatement laws like zyprexa, haldol, abilify and clozapine are
    poison that make impotent, is both physical (contracted muscles)
    and mental (make people hallucinate) torture and kills members
    of the victim groups. 

    SBN contains correspondence with the International Criminal Court,
    asking for arrest of the king of the netherlands, for the genocide
    he is committing with his new treatement laws. Current status is
    "no basis to proceed" judgement of the prosecutor which requires a
    "basis to prosecute" to have the king actually arrested.
