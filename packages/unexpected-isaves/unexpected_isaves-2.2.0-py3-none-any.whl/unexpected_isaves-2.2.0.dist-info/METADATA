<h1> Generate images as a spreadsheet, a Minecraft pixel art, an ascii art, or a rubik's cube art using Python </h1>

A quick scroll through social media and you'll find very talented people making portraits out of dice, rubik's cube, in minecraft as pixel art, or even using MIDI notes on a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). This package gives you the ability to do the same, with or without talent.
Currently it can only generate arts using minecraft, the cells of a spreadsheet, ascii characters, or rubik's cubes, but if you have any ideas that fit into the project's goal please [let me know](https://github.com/Eric-Mendes/unexpected-isaves/issues/10), or - even better - submit a merge request with your work!

## What does this package do :thinking:
With this package you can save any `image` on a given `path` as a
- Spreadsheet:

- Minecraft Pixel Art Datapack:

- Ascii Art:

- Rubik's Cube:

## How to use it :computer:
First you install it in your environment like this
```bash
pip install unexpected-isaves
```
Then you can start using it already! Pass the path of any image you've got locally and try to save it using our functions!
```python
from unexpected_isaves import save_image


save_image.to_excel(
    image="my_image.png",
    path="/home/user/Documents/my_image.xlsx"
)
```

## Why unexpected-isaves?
You might be wondering: why would I ever need such a useless lib? The answer is: you wouldn't. This lib was created for learning purposes, and it was never my intention to make it useful. It might be a nice way to impress your friends on your Minecraft server, or to make an important presentation lighter with a fun spreadsheet art, though. Be creative!

You can read our [wiki](https://github.com/Eric-Mendes/unexpected-isaves/wiki) for more information about this project if you want.
