# int-client

TODO:
- The client should install in the pc
- The client should receive a init command
- The client should create a int.ini in the root of project
- The int.init should contains the INTEGROH_API_KEY=XXX
- The API key should change depends on the project framework (like if it's a React.JS or a Python project)
