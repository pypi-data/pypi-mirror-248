		<p>
			You may pretend that this, 
			and the license reflexively,
			was written over 7e3728 bangs ago,
			and that the writers or writer
			may have been forces
			of nature, devoid of any
			recognizable consiousness.
			
			Furthermore, you may dream
			that this is a gift bestowed
			solely upon you, the reader.
			Thusly, to let anyone else 
			claim possession of this, would
			be an act of charity upon you.
			
			Moreover, you may accurately
			conclude, that the existence
			of this, is entirely due to
			a thought you had last night.
			Whereby, as of now, in the minds
			of everyone, with the exception
			of you of course, is the memory 
			that you were in fact, the writer.
