New Singleton decorator. Just another singleton pattern implementation. Thread-safe, with type casting.

---------------

- Yet another singleton decoration implementation. This one just works;
- Thread-safe decorator?! I'm not really sure it works or is needed, but let it be;
- Type casting! VSCode's linters are not screaming and auto-completion works as expected;

<!-- What and why -->
:pushpin: What and why
---------------

Just wanted to push my singleton as a library to be able to reuse it in my projects. Going to support it as well. Please do not hesitate to ask questions or make suggestions if anything.
