              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# ltermio - A Lightweight POSIX terminal I/O library

The package contains 5 modules: ***cursor***, ***termkey***, ***termouse***, ***color256*** and ***unicon***. Tested only on **MacOS terminal** and **iTerm2**, so the platform compatibility has not been well verfied yet.  
All functions are based on **XTerm** specification, **CSI** sequences and **termios**, no additional requirements other than the standard library.

**Applicability**: They are only for **POSIX** terminal applications.

References:  
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code>  
<https://www.xfree86.org/current/ctlseqs.html>

## Installation & Usage
Uses pip to install the package:

`pip3 install ltermio`

More details on module usage:

`pydoc ltermio.module-name`

## History & Why
As we all know, character terminal are outdated facilities, why did I still write such a package?

When I was learning **Python** a few months ago, I decided to write a terminal **Tetris** game as a practice of the language learning. Due to the learning reason, I did not want to use any third-party packages. So when I finally finished the game, there naturally formed this by-product.

## color256 module
Sets 256-color display attributes of character terminal.

There are three pairs of functions to set or restore colors according to their literal name:

```python
    set_fcolor(color: int)
    reset_fcolor()
    set_bcolor(color: int)
    reset_bcolor()
    set_color(fcolor: int, bcolor: int)
    reset_color()
```

Enum class *Color* defined constants of some common-used colors and grayscales, and more colors can be generated by function *make_color(r, g, b)*.

Following sample code prints gradually bright colorful greetings:

```python
    from ltermio import set_fcolor, reset_fcolor

    for i in range(6):
        for char in 'Hello, color256!':
            set_fcolor(ord(char) % 32 + 20 + i * 36)
            print(char, end='')
        print('')
    reset_fcolor()
```

Another sample to output all colors:

```python
    from ltermio import make_color, set_bcolor, reset_bcolor

    for red in range(6):
        for green in range(6):
            for blue in range(6):
                set_bcolor(make_color(red, green, blue))
                print('  ', end='')
        print('')
    reset_bcolor()
```

## cursor module
Wrapper functions of the **CSI(Control Sequence Introducer)** sequences about cursor and screen.

The sequences of following functions based on are not part of the **ANSI** specification, but be supported by most of terminals.

```python
    show_cursor()
    hide_cursor()
    switch_screen()
    restore_screen()
```

A several of additional functions are provided for text composing:

```python
    v_composing(seq: str) -> str
    downward_seq(text: str, cols: int) -> str
    vert_seq(text: str) -> str
    rect_border_seq(width: int, height: int, sym: str) -> str
```

Following sample code of *v_composing()* displays three big colorful greetings:

```python
    from ltermio import putmsg, v_composing

    _P1 = ':{0}\x1b3hj'
    _P15 = ':{0}\x1b6l:{0}\x1b11hj'
    _DASH = '5:{0}\x1b11hj'
    _NEXT_POS = '5k17l'

    LETTERS = {
        'E': v_composing(f'{(_DASH + _P1) * 2}{_DASH}{_NEXT_POS}'),
        'H': v_composing(f'{_P15 * 2}{_DASH}{_P15 * 2}{_NEXT_POS}'),
        'L': v_composing(f'{_P1 * 4}{_DASH}{_NEXT_POS}'),
        'O': v_composing(f'{_DASH}{_P15 * 3}{_DASH}'),
    }

    greeting = ''.join(map(LETTERS.get, 'HELLO'))
    putmsg(3, 20, greeting.format('\u2b50'))
    putmsg(9, 14, greeting.format('\u2b55'))
    putmsg(15, 8, greeting.format('\U0001f7e2'))
    print('\n')
```

## termkey module
Functions to read input in non-canonical mode.

There are 5 ***curses*** like functions:

+ *getch()*: Gets a character from stdin.
+ *ungetch()*: Puts one or more characters into the key buffer.
+ *getkey()*: Calls getch() and transforms character to keycode.
+ *ungetkey()*: Puts a keycode into the key buffer.
+ *setparams()*: Sets frenquently-used attributes of the input.

And a function to support mouse tracking.

+ *mouse_handler()*: Sets a function to handle mouse report.

Function keycodes in common using are defined in enum class *Key*.

A typical usage example as following:

```python
    import ltermio
    from ltermio import Key

    ltermio.setparams(echo=False)
    key = ltermio.getkey()
    while key != Key.ESC:
        ...
        key = ltermio.getkey()
    ltermio.setparams()
```

## termouse module
Detects and reports mouse events.

The implementation of the module follows the **XTerm** specification of the mouse tracking and uses normal tracking mode, see also:

<https://www.xfree86.org/current/ctlseqs.html#Mouse%20Tracking>
    
Calls *ltermio.mouse_tracking_on()* to turn on the mouse tracking, or sets the parameter `mouse=True` on the decorator *ltermio.appentry_args()*.

The mouse events are reported by *ltermio.getkey()*, with value encoded in a 32-bits integer and larger than *Key.MOUSE_EVENT*. It is simple to make difference from normal key codes by `code > Key.MOUSE_EVENT`.  
Decodes the event codes by calling *ltermio.decode_mouse_event()* which returns a tuple with explicit items.
        
An example to get key and mouse inputs as following:

```python
    from ltermio import Key, MouseEvent

    ltermio.mouse_tracking_on()
    ltermio.setparams(echo=False)

    code = ltermio.getkey()
    while code != Key.CONTROL_X:
        if code > Key.MOUSE_EVENT:
            event, row, col, modifiers = ltermio.decode_mouse_event(code)
            if event == MouseEvent.B1_CLICKED:
                ... # do something with mouse event
        else:
            ... # do something with key input
        code = ltermio.getkey()

    ltermio.setparams(echo=True)
    ltermio.mouse_tracking_off()
```

## unicon module
Collection of some common icons in unicode character set.
