.. :changelog:

2.1.0 (2023-11-06)
==================

.. FIXME/2023-11-06: make-docs/RTD do not show bulleted/indented
   list when outer list in unordered (`*`) but it works when you
   use an ordered (`#.`) list.

* Feature: Update build system to Poetry

  * Adopt `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`__,
    replacing ``distutils`` and ``setuptools`` build tools.

  * Modernize ``pyproject.toml``, per
    `PEP-517 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/>`__.

  * Remove ``setup.cfg`` and ``setup.py``,
    and ``requirements/*.pip``.

* Feature: Fully automated GitHub Actions CI tooling

  * All checks (lint & test) converted to GitHub Actions, from Travis CI.

  * New: Plumbed a full-featured, fully-automated release workflow.

    * Just push a version tag, and the workflow does the rest.

    * It'll test, build, publish, and verify the release.

    * This also starts a *release cascade*:

      The "closest" repos downstream (within the org) will be notified.

      These repos will update their dependencies, version and release
      themselves, and then continue the cascade.

      Eventually, one or more end user apps will be updated, versioned,
      and released, and the cascade will stop, all from a single tag on
      a different project. *One and done,* as they say.

2.0.14 (2020-07-02)
===================

* Docs: Update documentation.

2.0.13 (2020-06-29)
===================

* Bugfix: Avoid typifying value (e.g., to str) before conform callback.

2.0.12 (2020-04-25)
===================

* Feature: Option to collect errors on update, rather than raise.

2.0.11 (2020-04-25)
===================

* Bugfix: ``apply_edits`` returning *mutated* default.

* Improve: Optional method to recover storable value.

2.0.10 (2020-04-18)
===================

* Bugfix: ``as_dict`` excludes custom user settings because not marked from-config.

  * That is, when a client calls ``update_gross`` to add free-form custom user
    config (i.e., settings that were not defined by an ``@section``-decorated
    config function), be sure to mark the values as from-config, and not
    from-default. Otherwise, ``as_dict`` ignores the values, thinking they're
    not from the user.

* Bugfix: When ``apply_items`` extracts config dict, ``skip_unset`` not honored.

* Feature: Option to include section even if all keys were excluded (``as_dict``).

* Feature: New classmethod for re-rooting section.

* Improve: New ``set_section`` method to add subsections.

2.0.9 (2020-04-17)
