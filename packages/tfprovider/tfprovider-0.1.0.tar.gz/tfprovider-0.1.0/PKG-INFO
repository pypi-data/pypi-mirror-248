# tfprovider(-python)

This is a library to allow you to write Terraform providers in Python.

NOT USABLE YET for anyone but myself, trust me.

## Implemented/missing features

If you need any of these, please either open an issue (on GitLab or GitHub,
doesn't matter to me) or comment on an existing one and I'll see what I can do.
In contrast to larger projects, I prefer +1 comments over thumbs ups *for now*
(!) because they are easier for me to get notified of.

Most of them aren't difficult or time-consuming for me to implement, there is
just no point doing it if nobody needs it.

- General:
  - [ ] Not being completely horrible to use and full of bugs
- Kinds of Terraform objects:
  - [x] Resources
  - [ ] Data sources
- Terraform data types:
  - [x] Strings
  - [x] Sets of strings
  - [x] Unrefined unknowns
  - [ ] Refined unknowns
  - [ ] Anything else, including more complex types
- Miscellaneous features:
  - [ ] Private state
  - [ ] Upgrading state from earlier versions
    - Currently has an API for this that can't possibly work => needs overhaul
- Utilities:
  - [ ] Automatic comparison for `requires_replace`

## Development

### Sync/Async variants

The sync variant of the API is automatically generated from the async one
using [unasync](https://pypi.org/project/unasync/). With dev dependencies
installed, you can regenerate them by running `run_unasync.py` as a Python
script (e.g. via `poetry run run_unasync.py`).
