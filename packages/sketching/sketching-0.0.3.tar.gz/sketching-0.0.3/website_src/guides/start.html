        Sketching.py offers multiple pathways depending on where you want to start coding first. Want to learn a little bit more about Sketching before you start programming? Check out our <a href="/guides/why.html">why sketching</a> page.
    </div>

    <section class="subsection" id="web">
        <h3>Web</h3>
        <div>
            For the easiest place to get started, we have an <a href="/editor.html">online editor</a> where you can build your sketchbook without installing any software. All you need is a browser! Note that Sketching running on the web installs as a pure-Python wheel so no additional dependencies like numpy are needed. Two sketches to get you started:

            <ul>
                <li><a href="/examples/web/example.html?sketch=hello_static">Hello World: Static</a></li>
                <li><a href="/examples/web/example.html?sketch=hello_interactive">Hello World: Interactive</a></li>
            </ul>

            Looking for more inspiration? Check out the <a href="/examples.html">examples</a>. Once you've tried your first bits of code, learn how to <a href="/guides/deploy.html#web">deploy your sketches or embed them in larger web pages</a>. Need some help or maybe you found a bug? Check out the <a href="/community.html">community section</a> for links to chat rooms, bug tracker, and more. Note that the web version uses the <a href="/reference/Sketch2DWeb.html">Sketch2DWeb renderer</a> which is built on top of <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> and <a href="https://pyscript.net/">PyScript</a>.

    <section class="subsection" id="local">
        <h3>Desktop</h3>
        <div>
            You can use Sketching.py locally on your own machine like a laptop or desktop using plain old Python programs in ".py" files. The bare minimum install:

            <pre>pip install pillow sketching</pre>

            Try making a simple image in this <a href="https://codeberg.org/sketching/Sketchingpy/src/branch/main/examples/static/hello_static.py?ref_type=heads">static renderer example</a>. If you want to make interactive or animated sketches:

            <pre>pip install pillow pygame sketching</pre>

            After pip is done, try an <a href="https://codeberg.org/sketching/Sketchingpy/src/branch/main/examples/local/hello_interactive.py?ref_type=heads">interactive example</a> or explore how to make <a href="/guides/deploy.html#desktop">stand-alone executables</a>. The larger <a href="/examples.html">examples</a> section may be a good next stop as well. Run into some trouble? Visit the <a href="/community.html">community page</a> for our Discord, issue tracker, and more. Note that this type of desktop usage for Sketching.py uses the <a href="/reference/Sketch2D.html">Sketch2D renderer</a> and <a href="/reference/Sketch2DStatic.html">Sketch2DStatic renderer</a> built on top of <a href="https://www.pygame.org/news">Pygame</a> and <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Pillow</a>.

            Pair the power of scientific programming with the expressiveness and flexibility of creative coding. Get started by installing:

            <pre>pip install matplotlib pillow sketching</pre>

            Then, take a look at an example <a href="https://codeberg.org/sketching/Sketchingpy/src/branch/main/examples/static/example_notebook.ipynb?ref_type=heads">Jupyter Notebook</a> that uses pyplot to embed your sketches. Learn more about what you can do with Sketching.py by reading through the <a href="/examples.html">examples</a>. Need just a little more help? Visit the <a href="/community.html">community tab</a> to connect with other users, let developers know about problems, and more. Note that we currently recommend using the <a href="/reference/Sketch2DStatic.html">Sketch2DStatic renderer</a> with Jupyter.

    <section class="subsection" id="mobile">
        <h3>Mobile</h3>
        <div>
            More details on mobile coming soon. Until then, try taking a look at Sketching.py's <a href="#web">web option</a> which is also intended to work for mobile browsers.

        <h3>Other (static)</h3>
        <div>
            You can run Sketching.py just about anywhere you can execute Python. This includes servers which don't have desktop environments. The minimum install:

            <pre>pip install sketching pillow</pre>

            This will enable use of the <a href="/reference/Sketch2DWeb.html">Sketch2DStatic renderer</a> built on top of <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Pillow</a> and it can be used in headless environments.
