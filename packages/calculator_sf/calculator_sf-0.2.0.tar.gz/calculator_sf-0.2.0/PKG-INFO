# Calculator

The Calculator class provides a basic calculator with memory storage, supporting various mathematical operations. It allows users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and Nth root calculations. The calculator also provides functionality to reset its memory to its initial state.

## Installation

You can install the Calculator package using pip:
``` bash
    # Install package
    pip install calculator_sf
```

## Usage

### Creating a Calculator

```python
from calculator_module import Calculator

# Create a calculator with default memory (0.0)
calculator = Calculator()

# Create a calculator with an initial memory of 5.0
calculator_with_memory = Calculator(memory=5.0)
```

### Performing Operations
# Addition
```python
calculator.add(5.0)
```
# Subtraction
```python
calculator.subtract(2.0)
```
# Multiplication
```python
calculator.multiply(3.0)
```
# Division
```python
calculator.divide(2.0)
```
# Nth root
```python
calculator.n_root(2)
```

# Reset memory
```python
calculator.reset()
```

### Getting Current Values
```python
# Get current memory value
current_memory = calculator.get_memory()
```

# Get current decimal places setting
```python
decimal_places = calculator.get_decimal_places()
```

### Testing
```python
pip install pytest
pytest test_calculator.py
```
