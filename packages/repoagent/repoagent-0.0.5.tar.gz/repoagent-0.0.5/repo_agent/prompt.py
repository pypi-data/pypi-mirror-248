The path of the document you need to generate in this project is {file_path}.
Now you need to generate a document for a {code_type_tell}, whose name is {code_name}.

The content of the code is as follows:
{code_content}

{reference_letter}
{referencer_content}

Please generate a detailed explanation document for this object based on the code of the target object itself {combine_ref_situation}.

Please write out the function of this {code_type_tell} in bold plain text, followed by a detailed analysis in plain text (including all details), in language {language} to serve as the documentation for this part of the code.
