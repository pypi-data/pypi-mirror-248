## Introduction

`edx-helper` is a simple tool to download videos and lecture materials from Open
edX-based sites.  

It is platform independent, and should work fine under Unix (Linux, BSDs etc.), Windows or Mac OS X.

## Installation instructions

`edx-helper` requires Python 3 and very few other dependencies. (As of October 2023, `edx-helper` passed the test of Python versions 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11).

### Installation (recommended)

Opening a terminal and typing the command If you have installed Python:

    pip install edx-helper

### Manual Installation

    pip install git+https://github.com/csyezheng/edx-helper.git

or

```
git clone https://github.com/csyezheng/edx-helper.git
cd edx-helper
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

### Docker container

You can run this application via [Docker](https://docker.com) if you want. Just install docker and run

```
docker run --rm -it \
       -v "$(pwd):/Downloaded" \
       csyezheng/edx-helper -u <USER> -p <PASSWORD> COURSE_URL
```

* Please note that it will prompt that unable to find the image locally, please wait patiently for downloading.
* The course files will be downloaded to your current directory.

### Optional: update youtube-dl

One of the most important dependencies of `edx-helper` is `youtube-dl`. The
installation step listed above already pulls in the most recent version of
`youtube-dl` for you.

Unfortunately, since many Open edX sites store their videos on Youtube and
Youtube changes their layout from time to time, it may be necessary to
upgrade your copy of `youtube-dl`.  There are many ways to proceed here, but
the simplest is to simply use:

    pip install --upgrade youtube-dl

## Quick Start

Run the following command to query the usage and options:

```
edx-helper --help
```

### List courses

Run the following command to query the courses in which you are enrolled:

    edx-helper -u <email> --list-courses

### Download course

From there, choose the course you are interested in, copy its URL and use it
in the following command:

    edx-helper -u <email> COURSE_URL

Your downloaded videos will be placed in a new directory called
`Downloaded`, inside your current directory, but you can also choose another
destination with the `-o` argument.

### More download options

Normal download:

```
edx-helper -u <user> COURSE_URL
```

Download with subtitles:

```
edx-helper -u <user> --with-subtitles COURSE_URL
```

Specify download directory：

```
edx-helper -u <user> -o ~/courses/ COURSE_URL
```

Specify additional downloads by extension:

```
edx-helper -u <user> --file-formats "png,jpg" COURSE_URL
```

Download CDN videos, do not download youtube videos:

```
edx-helper -u <user> --prefer-cdn-videos COURSE_URL
```

To see all available options and a brief description of what they do, simply
execute:

    edx-helper --help

*Important Note:* To use sites other than <edx.org>, you **have** to specify the
site along with the `-x` option. For example, `-x stanford`, if the course
that you want to get is hosted on Stanford's site.

## Troubleshooting

### china-issues

China cannot access YouTube. Please use the  `--prefer-cdn-videos`  option first, or use the `--ignore-errors` option. If you want to download YouTube videos, please use a proxy.

## Reporting issues

Before reporting any issue please follow the steps below:

1. Verify that you are running the latest version of all the programs (both of `edx-helper` and of `youtube-dl`).  Use the following command if in doubt:

        pip install --upgrade edx-helper
   
2. If you get an error like `"YouTube said: Please sign in to view this video."`, then we can't do much about it. You can try to pass your credentials to `youtube-dl` (see https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl#authentication-options) with the use of `edx-helper`'s option `--youtube-dl-options`. If it doesn't work, then you will have to tell `edx-helper` to ignore the download of that particular video with the option `--ignore-errors`.
   
3. If the problem persists, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/csyezheng/edx-helper/issues) in our bug tracker, please fill the issue template with *as much information as
possible*.
