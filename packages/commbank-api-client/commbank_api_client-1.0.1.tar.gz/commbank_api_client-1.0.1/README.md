## Documentation

For sample usages, see `main.py`

For type documentation, see `commbank-api-client/types.py`. Note that the unique identifier for a transaction can be either `Transaction.id` or `Transaction.transaction_details_request`.
Some transactions do not have an ID, so transaction_details_request is used instead to uniquely identify said transaction, and vice versa. Each transaction is identified by one or the other.
