## Introduction

Provide a brief introduction to your project. Mention its purpose, main features, and any other relevant information.

## Features

List the key features of your project. What makes it unique or useful?

## Installation

```bash
pip install turing-machine-utils
```

## Usage

```python
from turing_machine_utils import create_turing_machine

# Define Turing Machine states, alphabet, and transition rules
states = ['q0', 'q1', 'accept', 'discard']
transition_rules = {
    ('q0', '0'): ('q1', '1', 'R'),
    ('q0', '1'): ('q0', '0', 'R'),
    ('q1', '0'): ('accept', '0', 'L'),
    ('q1', '1'): ('discard', '1', 'L'),
}

# Define the input tape
tape = ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0']

# Run the Turing Machine
result = create_turing_machine(tape, states, transition_rules)
print("Result:", result)
```

The result will be:
1. 1 if the tape is accepted by the turing machine
1. -1 if the state is discarded by the turing machine
1. 0 if an undefined transition is found by the turing machine
