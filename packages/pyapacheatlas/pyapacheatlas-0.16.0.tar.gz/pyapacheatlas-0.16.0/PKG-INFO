Description: 
        # PyApacheAtlas: A Python SDK for Azure Purview and Apache Atlas
        
        PyApacheAtlas lets you work with the Azure Purview and Apache Atlas APIs in a Pythonic way. Supporting bulk loading, custom lineage, custom type definition and more from an SDK and Excel templates / integration.
        
        The package supports programmatic interaction and an Excel template for low-code uploads.
        
        ## Using Excel to Accelerate Metadata Uploads
        
        * Bulk upload entities.
          * Upload entities / assets for built-in or custom types.
          * Supports adding glossary terms to entities.
          * Supports adding classifications to entities.
          * Supports creating relationships between entities (e.g. columns of a table).
        * Creating custom lineage between existing entities.
        * Defining Purview Column Mappings / Column Lineage.
        * Bulk upload custom type definitions.
        * Bulk upload of classification definitions (Purview Classification Rules not supported).
        
        ## Using the Pythonic SDK for Purview and Atlas
        
        The PyApacheAtlas package itself supports those operations and more for the advanced user:
        * Programmatically create Entities, Types (Entity, Relationship, etc.).
        * Perform partial updates of an entity (for non-complex attributes like strings or integers).
        * Extracting entities by guid or qualified name.
        * Creating custom lineage with Process and Entity types.
        * Working with the glossary.
          * Uploading terms.
          * Downloading individual or all terms.
        * Working with classifications.
          * Classify one entity with multiple classifications.
          * Classify multiple entities with a single classification.
          * Remove classification ("declassify") from an entity.
        * Working with relationships.
          * Able to create arbitrary relationships between entities.
          * e.g. associating a given column with a table.
        * Deleting types (by name) or entities (by guid).
        * Performing "What-If" analysis to check if...
           * Your entities are valid types.
           * Your entities are missing required attributes.
           * Your entities are using undefined attributes.
        * Azure Purview's Search: query, autocomplete, suggest, browse.
        * Authentication to Azure Purview using azure-identity and Service Principal
        * Authentication to Apache Atlas using basic authentication of username and password.
