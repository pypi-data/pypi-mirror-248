# Welcome to SageWorks
The SageWorks framework makes AWSÂ® both easier to use and more powerful. SageWorks handles all the details around updating and managing a complex set of AWS Services. With a simple-to-use Python API and a beautiful set of web interfaces, SageWorks makes creating AWS ML pipelines a snap. It also dramatically improves both the usability and visibility across the entire spectrum of services: Glue Job, Athena, Feature Store, Models, and Endpoints, SageWorks makes it easy to build production ready, AWS powered, machine learning pipelines.
