FOREWORD
Dear reader,
climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing humanity today – and
overcoming it requires not only an evolution in the way we live our lives, but
also a green modification on how we do business.
Driving this transformation is the European Green Deal, which strives to
drastically reduce carbon emissions, increase sustainable practices and,
ultimately, make Europe the world’s first climate-neutral continent by 2050.
But achieving these goals requires that companies take a deep look at their
internal operations, and supply chains to identify opportunities for reducing
their own environmental footprint.
It is where the EU Space Programme comes into play.
While EU Space data and services are essential assets to supporting the implementation of the Green Deal,
businesses stand to benefit too. For example, Copernicus, Galileo and EGNOS supply the information companies
need to monitor environmental indicators, reduce their environmental impact, become more sustainable and drive
the green transformation. Better yet, much of this data is openly accessible and provided free of charge.
To help companies utilise this data as a means of driving their own sustainability journeys, EUSPA has compiled the
first #EUSpace for the Green Transformation report. In the following pages, we introduce the Green Deal, its
implications for companies and, most importantly, how the EU Space Programme can help businesses become more
sustainable.
Leveraging our team’s collective expertise in #EUSpace, we have created a report that every company can use to
monitor their sustainability targets. The report includes detailed, real-world examples to inspire companies on how
to use #EUSpace for clean industry, construction and renovation, smart and sustainable mobility, a healthier and
green food system, and restoring ecosystems and biodiversity.
Whether it be increasing the efficiency of renewable energy infrastructure, enabling more efficient flightpaths, or
implementing precision agriculture operations, I’m confident that this report will become a go-to-source for your
green transformation and a trusted roadmap in your sustainability journey.
Happy reading!

EU SPACE FOR GREEN TRANSFORMATION
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In December 2019, the European Commission announced the European Green Deal, a package of policies and
initiatives to answer the United Nation’s 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. This ambitious
roadmap towards a climate-resilient society aspires to make the European Union’s economy sustainable, turning
climate and environmental challenges into opportunities. The Green Deal is designed to transform Europe into the
first climate-neutral continent, achieving zero net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050.
As tighter regulation and legislation appear on the horizon and purchasing and investment patterns place ever-
higher importance on sustainability, companies embark on their sustainability journey. Not just external factors
(regulation, revenues), but also internal ones, such as talent attraction, employee productivity, motivation and
retention, are growing in significance. This is reflected in the key figures presented below: firstly, the appeal of a
prospective employer to students and young professionals is 25% higher for companies whose green transformation
is already underway1. Secondly, and most crucially, the market for the green transformation itself stands at € 15
billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 21.9% to 20302. Finally, a staggering 85% majority of Moody’s
debt ratings took ESG into account in 2020 3 – demonstrating clearly that the investment appetite is rising for
companies strong in environmental, social and governance matters. As a matter of fact, the broader impetus for the
green transformation is also born from the need to build climate resilience, as the world’s society and industry
anticipate the transformation climate change will bring to daily lives, livelihoods, consumption, shipping, and all
aspects of life and the market.
Exhibit 1: Why Pursuing the green transformation - key figures
Performing the green transformation requires that a company takes a deep look through their internal operations,
as well as their surrounding supply chain to understand where and how pollution and waste occur. In that regard,
the slew of tools newly-available in the 21st century – including remote sensing, location-based services, artificial
intelligence and many others – makes monitoring, tracking, evaluating and implementing sustainable operations not
just possible, but long-term profitable.
The EU Space Programme is able to provide value to all players across supply and value chains, sectors and activities,
chiefly with its Copernicus (Earth Observation) and EGNSS (positioning, navigation and timing) components. From
renewable energy generation and distribution to industrial waste management, wildlife monitoring, urban planning
and fleet management, the Copernicus and Galileo can offer a host of independent, as well as synergistic services
to aid companies along their sustainability journeys and support them in greening their operations.
EU Space data and services are an important asset to support the implementation of the Green Deal objectives. At
government level, Galileo and Copernicus are essential tools for environmental monitoring, as they provide
reliable and nearly real-time data on positioning and Earth Observation. Policies can be shaped based on reality and
thoughtful corrective actions can be taken, when necessary.

In the context of a more sustainable society and ESG scoring, companies are setting green transformation targets to
reduce greenhouse emissions and environmental footprint of their operations, as well promote their actions to
attract customers and increase their market shares. Business benefit from a myriad of possible applications for
EU space data, which translates into not only greener practices, but also cost reduction and increased efficiency.
For example, a green urban development relies on solid geospatial data. EGNSS has a fundamental role in reducing
greenhouse emissions, consonant to the Green Deal’s ambitions. Aiming a smart and sustainable mobility, Galileo
is a key tool for reducing travel time and fuel consumption. Satellite data provided by Copernicus and Galileo play
a key role in improving the food system, developing sustainable and efficient practices. The EU space data
enables precision agriculture by mapping the evolution of crops and precisely navigating to the intervention areas.
Ecosystems and biodiversity preservation are vital for the maintenance of life on Earth. In this respect, Copernicus
data is especially appropriate for monitoring the environment, providing crucial climate-biodiversity indicators.
Almost all the consulted companies (direct interviews and surveys) stated that they are currently not leveraging
EU Space Data for pursuing their green transformation objectives. Many consulted companies acknowledged
that the potential for EU Space data is enormous and expressed their interest to know more about it and
possibly being engaged by EUSPA in further action.
This study aims to introduce the EU Green Deal, its implications for companies, and how EU Space can help
companies to address their green transformation, presenting current practices of EU-based champions in
sustainability management, and how companies can benefit from the EU Space Programme applications. More
specifically, the study aims to:
▪ Understand the Green Deal and the implications for companies: The Green Deal comes with implications
that ripple through the entire corporate ecosystem and provides companies with opportunities as well as
the need to react to the changing regulatory and policy framework.
▪ Analyse how companies currently address green transformation: Companies (and investors) are focusing
more and more on sustainability. The understanding of the methods, measures, and tools used by the
companies for their green transformation is crucial to identify which gaps can be filled by the EU Space
Programme.
▪ Describe the full potential of EU Space data for green transformation: Present the way companies can
use EU Space data and services to help them on their path towards sustainability. Provide an analysis to
quantify and qualify current and future benefits (e.g., monetary, efficiency related) of using EU Space data
and their value-added for green transformation. Show specific practical use cases of currently deployed
applications.
▪ Provide a call for action to companies: present a call for action for companies that are less aware of the
EU Space Programme benefits to engage with EUSPA to understand how to maximise the use of EU Space
data and services to support their green transformation.
During the study, both secondary and primary research have been conducted. In particular, a stakeholder
consultation has been performed through direct industry interviews and a web survey aimed both to space services
providers and user companies. As a result of the consultation, about thirty companies provided useful insights and
inputs used throughout the report.
The participating companies range from listed companies all the way to SMEs, from manufacturing to service sector
companies. Some examples of consulted companies are listed in Exhibit 2.

The European Union Agency for Space Programme (EUSPA)’s core mission is to implement the EU Space
Programme and to provide reliable, safe and secure space-related services, maximising their socio-economic
benefits for European society and business. The lack of awareness towards the EU Space Programme and its
benefits for companies can only be overcome by fostering the collaboration between the European Commission,
EUSPA, adopters of EU space-based solutions and service providers. The development of innovative and
competitive business models related to the green transformation and in support of the Green Deal objectives cannot
be separated from the effort made by companies willing to contribute to the wellness of EU citizens and the
development of a greener and more inclusive society.

1. INTRODUCTION
Study context and approach
Climate change is one of the biggest challenges of humanity and its severe impacts to society are just beginning to
emerge. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by human activities e.g., manufacturing, transport, energy production and
distribution, agriculture are the most accountable to this phenomenon.
Exhibit 3: Greenhouse gas emissions global and by sector
To overcome climate change in the long term, we must drastically reduce anthropogenic emissions and encourage
a strong shift towards sustainability and green transformation. In this context, much importance is given to our
transition to a more sustainable way of living and working. This necessitates a shift in thinking and in mode of
operations – away from environmentally-harmful practices and unsustainable resource use and towards
ecological mindfulness.
The EU intends to be at the forefront of this shift and has enabled the European Green Deal that will actively
support the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) put forth by the United Nation’s 2030 Agenda5.
The European Green Deal acts as a general directive with multiple targets, namely, supplying clean, affordable, and
secure energy, mobilising industry for a clean circular economy, building and renovating in an energy- and resource-
efficient way, moving to a toxic-free environment, preserving and restoring ecosystems and biodiversity, creating an
environmentally friendly food system, and accelerating the shift to sustainable and smart mobility.
The ultimate goal of the set of policies around the Green Deal is to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent
and to achieve zero net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050. This will be achieved by employing clean
technologies across different industries to build a green economic model. An important milestone to reach this target
is the reduction of emissions of at least 55% compared to 1990 levels already by 2030.

The mission of the European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA) is to support the EU’s goal to
achieve the highest return on the EU Space Programme's investment in terms of benefits to users, economic
growth and industry competitiveness. The EU Space Programme, including its flagships Copernicus, Galileo and
EGNOS, can be critical to supply the necessary information for Europe to make it more sustainable, and to support
industry and policy makers to monitor environmental indicators, but also to reduce the environmental impacts.
Copernicus, world’s most advanced Earth Observation system, has been monitoring the Earth’s environment for
years, providing a unique combination of full, free and open data and thematic information services. The Copernicus
Climate Change Service (C3S) provides past, current and future projections on climate and its changes, while the
Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) delivers data and information about air quality and its
corresponding density of pollutants. Copernicus data supports governments and businesses to monitor industrial
emissions sentinel-4 and Sentinel-5/5P have capabilities to acquire atmospheric measurements of the airborne
pollutants such as COx and NOX with a high spatial-temporal resolution.
Galileo and EGNOS contribute to the European Green Deal by providing accurate positioning, navigation and timing.
The positioning signals, often in combination with Copernicus data, enable smart farming or precision agriculture
that allows farmers to save fuel, pesticides and fertilisers, and limit water waste. Its benefits stretch along many
sectors, with e.g., emission reduction for road transport and route optimisation in the maritime and aviation sectors.
As the EU Space Programme is continuously expanding with more data, signals and services, more and more
applications are enabled for governments and businesses, many supporting our common goal of a greener economy.
Additional details about the European Global Navigation System and Copernicus are described in Annex 1.
Exhibit 4: Examples of EU Space contribution to key elements of Green Transformation
The cumulative environmental benefits enabled by the EU Space Programme in energy, road transport, aviation,
agriculture, forestry, and mining are substantial. Tons of polluting emissions can be avoided, and more efficient
use of our resources could save billions to the public and to businesses.
Despite the ample benefits, the EU Space Programme still lacks awareness with industrial stakeholders. Most of
the surveyed companies for this report state that they are currently not leveraging EU Space data in their pursuit
of green transformation, but many are keen to explore how this data and signals can support this.
EU SPACE FOR GREEN TRANSFORMATION

The purpose of this study is to analyse the contribution of EU Space Programme data and services to the European
Green Deal objectives for sustainability and show case how the EU Space Programme can support companies
towards their green transformation paths.
The overall study approach is based on four-steps, starting from the first two tasks to establish an understanding
of the Green Deal’s objectives and action areas, as they pertain to changes in policy (1), and reflected in companies’
green journeys (2). The third step entails the synthesis of various sustainability metrics to identify EU-based
companies embracing the green transformation, to outline how EU Space can support (3), and interview companies
to gain insights on how they tackled and monitored green transformation and environmental impacts in their
respective sectors, and also on how EU Space Data contributed (if in any way yet) and might contribute in the future.
Finally, the fourth step relates to the generation of informed recommendations (4) for the promotion of EU-Space
to enable the green transformation in industry and help unlock efficiencies in companies’ sustainability and
operations.

2. THE GREEN TRANSFORMATION AND EU
GREEN DEAL FOR BUSINESS IN EUROPE
Green transformation market
The change in thinking observed across industry, policy and society towards more sustainable practices is often
framed under the moniker of “green transformation”. In the subject literature, this term is mostly defined as actions
aimed at creating equilibrium (agreement) between the economic growth and care for the environment, aimed at
guaranteeing a high quality of life for both present and future generations at the level allowed by the civilisational
development, and at the same time an effective and rational use of the available resources. This can be applied at
individual level, e.g., single companies or at group level, e.g., single countries, continents, world.
The green transformation is a dynamic process involving several sectors and actors of the economy and society,
such as energy production, distribution and storage, agriculture and forestry, natural resource extraction, building
construction and renovation, mobility, water supply and treatment, waste management, and environmental
remediation. However, this process is not meant to be a simple transition to a new model of business, as it influences
and requires changes in many aspects of everyday life, aiming to shift the entire societal cohort towards more
sustainable behaviour, to help abate and mitigate climate change.
The green transformation is not an idealised abstraction of society’s shift to sustainability, but rather a very tangible
concept – one which can create, and boost markets.
The EU itself plans to invest over €1 trillion over the next decade to support the European Green Deal.

Exhibit 6: European Green Deal action areas
As shown in Exhibit 7, the market size for the green transformation is expected to grow at an incredible pace
(+21.9% CAGR) from 20202. Companies indeed have started considering pursuing sustainability targets as a key
element of their narrative for their value proposition and competitive advantage.
EU SPACE FOR GREEN TRANSFORMATION

Exhibit 7: Global green transformation market2
It is increasingly understood across industries that the green transformation stands for the right strategic, financial,
and environmental direction. With a rapidly evolving policy framework exerting more and more pressure on
businesses, building climate resilience through the green transformation is now more a necessity than a strategic
niche. In addition, more stringent regulations imposing fines or trade impediments to avoid polluting practices and
environmental damages (such as for the use of nitrogenous compounds in agriculture) is a clear market enabler for
businesses to consider undergoing their own green transition.
Many sectors have spearheaded the change, especially the ones under the most regulatory scrutiny – namely: energy,
agriculture, and transport.
▪ In energy, decarbonisation is seeing the phasing-out of legacy, carbon-rich energy sources including oil,
coal, and natural gas. Large focus is also placed on improving the energy efficiency of distribution grids,
housing, and industry
▪ The agricultural sector is focusing on significant technology-based reductions in land and resource use,
and the redirection of operations toward carbon capture (producing increased added value in net emissions
reductions)
▪ In transport, the transition to electric powertrains has originated a now booming segment, with road
vehicles on an exponential adoption path – in reaction to, and anticipation of shifting regulation in the early
2030s. Similarly, efforts on green aviation are growing. Improvements in urban and rural mobility
infrastructure are also further integrating the sector into the digital sustainable era.
Among the contributing factors to the success of the green transformation6 in the energy industry is a supportive
regulatory environment. With ever-stricter regulations on the horizon, a funding and innovation framework
conducive to sustainable change, and the complement of a shifting regulatory landscape in the automobile industry,
legacy operators began to perform their transitions earlier than most. This, as discussed, will occur within most (if
not all) other economic sectors, as regulation is rolled out at a fast pace; the period of incremental change is ending.
Furthermore, supply-chain factors, such as the high volatility of input materials (coal, oil and gas) brought a further
impetus to move away from legacy operations. Though not directly transferrable to all sectors, this example is highly
illustrative of the need, and benefits of the green transformation, especially in the industries least adherent to
sustainable practices.
6 In this report green transformation and green transition are meant to be synonyms; while other publications might have different definitions for
each, we will align with the one given by Katarzyna Cheba - Directions of green transformation of the European Union countries

Green transformation impact on business
Though not expressly necessary, the green transformation is often tied with the use of modern, innovative digital
tools. Digitalisation, in turn, supplies tools for optimisation to underpin many efficiencies in resource use and waste
reduction, target tracking and monitoring, regulatory compliance, and the generation of decision-making data for
long-term planning. Many of these tasks stand to benefit from the range of applications offered by EU Space data
and signals. These efficiencies will be discussed to a greater extent in the coming sections, with associated tangible
use-cases and, where possible, economic impact analyses.
Significant investment is needed for the green transformation, covering the cost of the described process
assessment and redesign, modernisation (including digital and other tools, such as space-based products and
services, cloud computing, and others), as well as staff training and reskilling. Furthermore, it is necessary, for a
business to successfully perform their green transformation, to capture and keep employee, stakeholder, and
shareholder buy-in. In the early stages, there is often traction in overcoming the longstanding status quo of
operations. This period is, nevertheless, characterised by exponential growth – slow at first, but very rapid once the
first friction is overcome7.
A conceptual illustration of the overall profits seen by a company over their green transformation is provided in the
Exhibit below. As it has been the case in practice built upon Ørsted’s lessons learned8, it is likely for a company to
undergo a period of losses during the initial investment and restructuring phase. Then comes a period of
technological innovation and scale, diffusing benefits throughout the company (and supply chain), beginning to
bring returns on the initial efforts and investment, on a rapid but steady upward slope, and then showing stabilised
returns after a certain point.
Exhibit 8: The green transformation investment returns curve
In a shifting investor, consumer and employment landscape, the green transformation also brings advantages in
terms of public perception. As described previously, gathering support and providing a sound strategic vision to key
stakeholders around a business is key to the process. These include consumers and/or customers, policymakers,
employees, and other stakeholders (suppliers, shareholders, board members, and others).
Investors’ perspective
From the investor standpoint, as discussed, ESG risks hold an ever more important place in the investment go-
no-go decision process. Indicatively, 85% of Moody’s debt ratings in 2020 considered ESG risks as a material credit

item3. In being such a deeply transformative process, the green transition offers the opportunity for a business to
not only overhaul environmental bottlenecks and weaknesses, but also ones in the governance structure, as well as
internal social standing (and belief). There lie direct benefits, therefore, for companies to appeal more to investors,
thanks to their green transformation.
Customers’ perspective
There are arguably even stronger dynamics at play in consumer/customer perception. Multiple studies have been,
and continue to be conducted on the subject, as it is a rapidly evolving, for reasons already described. Of the most
notable trends is the ongoing shift in perception 9 of sustainable products from a niche category to rather an
important aspect of all product categories, a clear example is provided by the study from Ferguson10 recognising
how more than half of German and British consumers explicitly check for sustainable ingredients on shelf products
in stores; and more than 70% of customers in those countries is aware of brands associated with environmental
concerns. The increasing attention on the ESG and sustainability-related sides of a product or service also offers
businesses the capacity for reduced costs. Thanks to the homogenisation of consumer preference toward
sustainability, that aspect can be used as a singular marketing lever across different markets and regions, offering
scale economies. It is important, nevertheless, to note that current data shows that, in certain sectors such as food,
the traditional factors of price and quality remain more influential in mass consumer decisions than sustainability.11
Green transformation in regulatory requirements
The European Green Deal will have major structural implications for the EU economy in the coming decades,
affecting everything from the way we produce and use power, to how we travel, heat our homes, and even how we
eat. This is made possible through a series of policies which will be introduced or updated starting from already
existing measures.
Many of the policies put in place in the context of the European Green Deal will deeply affect business and
operations of European companies. Those changes are all focused in improving European environmental conditions
and making a greener and fairer society
To that end, in addition to the supportive policy environment the Green Deal will bring for the green transformation
and sustainable innovation, disincentives will be put into place as well. Though not expressly defined yet to date, a
comprehensive and cohesive system of fines and penalties will be set up (on top of mechanisms such as the
Emissions Trading System) to define the price of non-compliance.
A summary of the main changes to regulations proposed with the upcoming European Green Deal is shown in
Exhibit 9. For businesses, there lies a great opportunity to synergistically capitalise on the EU Space Programme
for their own sustainable transformation and monitoring, as well as for the improvement of their legal
compliance.
Those considerations are meant to be only indicative to provide with a general idea about potential applications of
the EU Space in relation to Green Deal-related regulatory updates. Detailed use cases underlining how the EU
Space applications are supporting/ can enable the green transformation and the journey of companies towards it,
are provided in the following sections of this document.

3. THE ROLE OF THE EU SPACE
PROGRAMME IN SUPPORTING COMPANIES
ALONG THEIR SUSTAINABILITY JOURNEY
The European Union Space Programme in all its components has already been introduced previously in this report,
together with a preliminary discussion about its role for the established Green Deal objectives. As anticipated, due
to the higher impact on the topic, this report will focus primarily on the European Global Navigation Satellite
Systems (EGNSS), including Galileo and EGNOS and Copernicus.
As for the EGNSS, their role in support of the Green Deal’s ambitions for emissions reductions is crucial. A key
example is the transport sector 13, including aviation, maritime, road, and rail transport. The sector contributes
heavily to emissions in Europe. The EU’s goal is to lower them by 90% by 2050, to meet the overall net neutrality
target set by the European Union.
The development of GNSS-enabled Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) for aviation has been a breakthrough in
that regard. Traditional route planning, using Ground-Based Augmentation Systems (GBAS), has required that a
point-by-point path is taken, cruising between navigation data sources (e.g., beacons). Rather than compromising
air routes to meet these requirements, Galileo and EGNOS allow planners to draft more direct paths between
destinations, prioritising performance – and thus, lower fuel use and emissions – by providing a constant stream of
navigation data and reducing (or eliminating) reliance on traditional GBAS. To that end, EGNSS data is also often
more accurate, and safer than ground-based alternatives.
Another use for EGNSS in aviation is Localiser Performance using Vertical guidance (LPV) approaches. Using
EGNSS data, aircraft operators can involve more accurate data (compared to conventional sources) in landing
procedures. That, in turn, allows automated manoeuvres which optimise performance and more closely follow the
ideal landing line, leading directly again to fuel savings, and thus reducing emissions.
In road transport, high-accuracy real-time EGNSS data, and Copernicus-based urban planning applications will
ease the transition into optimised assisted and fully autonomous driving. The network of semi- and fully autonomous
vehicles will then be able to cross-interface between vehicles, as well as with centralised control centres, using
GNSS to regulate and monitor traffic, optimise vehicle inputs (throttle, steering, route planning), as well as make
roads safer to run in.
While EGNSS allow users to improve their operations making them more efficient, Copernicus becomes particularly
useful when it comes to monitoring and having a better understanding of the environment around us. A concrete
example is provided by the use of Copernicus data to precisely position renewable energy infrastructure14.
The energy output in terms of watt-hour produced by sustainable sources like solar panels or wind turbines is highly
dependent on their correct positioning. Not only the right site is fundamental, but even the correct orientation makes
a significant difference. Copernicus services together with historical data provide energy companies with information
about solar radiation and wind behaviours on a world-wide base, allowing them to make informed decisions and
get the best from their infrastructure.
A detailed discussion about EGNSS and Copernicus in support of Green Deal goals will be the core of this section
of the report; it is important to understand that the role of the EU Space Programme for what concerns environmental
matters is not something vague and uncountable, but already effective and tangible. For example, the EU Space
already supports Green Deal aims such as CO2 reduction, smart mobility, cleaner energy production, and others. A

summary of those achievements is provided in a study15 promoted by the European Commission of which some of
the conclusions are reported in Exhibit 10.
Exhibit 10: Estimated impact of the EU Space Programme on selected markets and on the environment15
Since its first roll-out, Copernicus has been actively involved in monitoring pollution, land use, and waste
management, among other applications, for example:
▪ The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) provides daily forecasts of global air quality
that public and private authorities can use to determine citizens’ exposure to pollutants such as aerosols
and particulates. It is also useful for air traffic control in case of volcanic activity.
▪ The Copernicus Marine Service (CMEMS) oversees water quality monitoring and forecasting of pollutants
such as nitrates, phosphates, and dissolved iron in the sea from land and especially along the coast, but
also monitors organic pollution such as algal blooms, which are increasing with global warming and
eutrophication of the water.
▪ The European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) uses Sentinel satellite imagery to monitor sea pollution
such as oil spills and other polluters.
▪ The Copernicus Land Monitoring Service monitors changes in grassland rich Natura2000 hotspots for
nature conservation, to figure out whether these sites are being effectively preserved or if a decline in loss
of biodiversity is halted.
Copernicus with the C3S service is a crucial asset for monitoring climate change as it produces, on a global scale
basic climate variable describing the climate over time. More broadly, with its services and products, Copernicus
directly supports the objectives set up by the European Green Deal.

The role of the EU Space for Green Deal objectives and companies’ journey in the green transformation can be at
the highest level possible simplified into two macro-categories: environmental monitoring and environmental
footprint reduction, as defined in Exhibit 12. These two topics will be the core of the rest of this chapter and will be
tackled from the perspective of companies.

A first good example of the importance and benefit of the EU Space Programme for environmental monitoring is
provided by the insurance sector which relies more and more on space data in case of catastrophic events to
speed up refunding procedures helping affected populations to start reconstruction in the shortest time possible. A
detailed use case is provided in Exhibit below.
Exhibit 13: Use case - EU Space Programme for insurance companies
Challenge
▪ Climate change is making weather-related catastrophic events more and more common,
leaving populations affected to deal with reconstruction, massive losses in terms of
households and lives
▪ The “aftermath” of an extreme event includes reconstruction and damage assessment which
involve the affected population, governments, civil protection agencies, NGOs, insurance
companies and other stakeholders.
Role of the
Green Deal
▪ The European Green Deal promotes the shift towards a more just society in which economic
resources are more easily accessible to the population, especially in case of emergency such
as a catastrophic weather-related event

Monitoring insured assets
The insurance sector accounts globally for €5 trillion, and it is undergoing a profound evolution
driven by digital transformation. Collaboration between traditional insurers and InsurTech firms
will give rise to newer business models and revenue streams aiming at higher profitability and
reduced operational costs.
In the context of digitalisation, many of the traditional activities performed by insurers are now
highly dependent on the availability of large quantities of reliable data. Players in the sector are
eager to have both more precise risk models, and reliable asset monitoring systems to make their
operations more sustainable and therefore more profitable.
Having access to funds and resources coming from insurance companies' reimbursements in the
shortest possible time can be vital for people. The typical process can be very tricky and
inefficient, especially in cases of areas where access for insurance inspectors can be difficult due
to the occurred phenomena. Using satellite imagery for monitoring the affected areas, not only
can speed up those processes improving the life quality of affected people letting them to go back
to normality and reduce logistic costs for insurance companies. Post-event damage assessment,
asset monitoring and risk modelling driven by satellite data provide a reliable and up-to-date
date tool for insurance companies. In case of catastrophic events, many of the claims issued to
insurance companies can be addressed using space data. Satellite pre-disaster images are
matched with post-event ones to detect changes and highlight the entity of damages and
speed up claims management and funds unlocking.
Companies such as SkyTek are combining Copernicus data with commercially available ones to
address those topics.

Role of the EU Space in monitoring green transformation targets
Environmental monitoring activities are carried out on soil, atmosphere, and water by companies and institutions
with the scope to assess how human activities are interfering with the biosphere.
Historically, those activities always involved a first, in-situ sample collection, followed by a specific analysis
process, and a final data categorisation and visualisation.
▪ Air monitoring combines emissions, meteorological, and topographic data to detect and predict the
concentration of air pollutants in a determined aria. Environmental data is typically gathered using
specialised sensor networks placed locally in high-risk areas.
▪ Soil monitoring typically requires operators to grab and analyse soil samples to detect phenomena such as
acidification, biodiversity loss, contamination, erosion, organic material loss, salinization, and slope
instability. Main parameters on study are salinity, which, if imbalanced, can cause detrimental effects on
water quality and plant yield; chemical contaminations coming from toxic elements, such as nuclear waste,
coal ash, microplastics, petrochemicals, and acid rain, which can lead to the development of pollution-
related diseases if in contact with humans or animals; and erosion due to factors such as rainfall, surface
runoff, rivers, streams, floods, wind, mass movement, soil composition and structure, topography, and lack
of vegetation management.
▪ Water monitoring, is usually performed through the acquisition of samples from any water source (e.g.,
see, rivers, lakes, drinking water sources, etc.) to measure and monitor parameters such as biological
presence, chemical content, and microbiological parameters.
All the processes mentioned above are very resource-intensive, requiring personnel on the ground to either
conduct sensor maintenance or to physically collect samples.
The next paragraphs show how the EU Space Programme, and in particular Copernicus, can be used by institutional
and commercial players to make environmental monitoring more efficient and effective. Not only does the use of
space data allows to free up human and economic resources otherwise necessary, but it also makes possible more
frequent monitoring of areas difficult to be reached by human personnel.
Environmental monitoring is mandatory for certain companies, especially in the manufacturing industry. Monitoring
procedures are hard coded in countless regulations and standards; therefore, they are a topic very resistant to
innovation, leaving only limited room for the EU Space Programme, likely to only cover a secondary/support role in
the meaning of for example quickly identify risks and issues in companies’ infrastructure.
ESG is becoming a crucial aspect for modern companies, and it is foreseen to have much higher relevance in light of
the upcoming Green Deal relevant new regulations issued by the European Institutions.
Following the original directive about non-financial reporting issued by the European Union, the European
Commission adopted in 2021 a proposal for the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD),
encompassing a series of measures issued to ensure that large companies are required to report not only on financial
matters, but also on sustainability issues such as environmental footprint, social rights, human rights and
governance factors (i.e., ESG reporting). Starting in 2024, initially large companies (i.e., more than 500
employees), followed by listed SMEs, will have to embrace the CSRD to continue their operations in the European
Union.
EU SPACE FOR GREEN TRANSFORMATION
21
Exhibit 15: ESG main evaluation areas
Pushed by the change in non-financial reporting regulation, environmental monitoring with the purpose of
measuring ESG scores is an emerging and promising topic, yet in its development phases, and so more likely to
embrace innovation and new approaches. Therefore, the use of space data not only can be beneficial, but Copernicus
data might also be considered in the future as a standard for monitoring and measuring environmental indicators. In
this section, we will first provide a general introduction to ESG, and then we will focus on how the EU Space
Programme is currently integrated or can be integrated in the measurement of environmental KPIs.
Through the past half century, as shown in the earlier sections, topics such as global climate change, environment,
and sustainability have gained increasing importance. Companies are more and more sensitive to those topics,
high attention is given to those processes aimed at monitoring emissions and environmental footprint of companies’
operations, and, when possible, reducing them.
Furthermore, in the latest years, we have seen the rise of a social consciousness devoted to “save the planet”
through actions aimed to achieve a more sustainable society and economy. Companies recognised as
environmentally friendly are better placed to get new customers, new investors, and even new employees. On the
other hand, possible investors might find a company unattractive if its brand is linked to poor environmental
practices, and therefore they might prefer not to associate with it.
A good instrument to evaluate the performance of a company in terms of environmental effort and impact is the ESG
scoring. Environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) is an approach to evaluate efforts of a company
towards social goals beyond the core business of the organisation itself. More specifically:
▪ The environmental criteria, include factors such as the energy used and wasted by a company, the use of
resources, carbon emissions, and contribution to climate change.
▪ The social criteria, address the relationships the company has and the reputation it fosters with people and
institutions in the communities where the business is active. Factors such as fair treatment of employees,
diversity and inclusion are accounted for.
▪ The governance criteria are the internal system of practices, controls, and procedures companies adopt to
govern themselves.
EU SPACE FOR GREEN TRANSFORMATION

Companies are nowadays giving significant relevance to ESG – often driven by capital markets creating pressure to
achieve progress in this dimension. Shareholders and investors seek reflective and progressive policies in all three
of these realms and use it as a tool to weigh up a business’ overall sustainable performance. Customers and channel
partners are increasingly weighing in ESG compliance into their purchase decisions. Lastly, employees and
recruitment candidates value the sustainability ambition of their (potential) employer.
The graph below outlines the ESG framework adopted by Henkel, as an example.
Exhibit 16: Example - ESG goals and KPIs adopted by Henkel
The increasing importance ESG is acquiring in the modern society and way to do business, is well exemplified by a
recent study estimating that for certain industries the share of profit at stake in case of significant modifications
in environmental and social policies can reach up to 60%18.
Exhibit 17: Estimated share of EBITDA at risk due to ESG negative performance by industry
18 Source: McKinsey & Co - Five ways that ESG creates value
EU SPACE FOR GREEN TRANSFORMATION
23
All these factors together made ESG a predominant topic in companies’ directive boards, and the currently given
attention is only expected to grow in the next years boosted by ambitious targets such as the European Union
climate neutrality in 2050, and new regulations such as from the European Green Deal, committing the Union to
pursue a more sustainable and inclusive society.
In the recent BCG-INSEAD “Board ESG Pulse
Check” found that 70% of directors are only
moderately or not at all effective at
integrating ESG into company strategy and
governance.
Given the importance of ESG role in the modern corporate life, a reliable assessment and scoring system is necessary.
It needs to be objective, accurate and consistent. It should be able to provide comparable scores for businesses
across sectors and geographies. Given the global reach of space assets and their known ability to impact SDGs,
it is high time to investigate systematically space data and services contribution to the corporate ESG world.
Please refer to the following sections showing on how EU Space can contribute to ESG monitoring and reporting, in
particular, Exhibit 21 shows some examples of relevant KPIs to be monitored and how EU Space can be beneficial
in doing that.
ESG Monitoring ecosystems and value chains are still under development. The business world has gone a long way
from initial alibi-reporting and upgraded Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reporting. Rightly so, some of these
efforts have and are being criticised by media and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) as greenwashing. The
finance world is gradually adopting ESG products and mechanisms to track this.
Four major drivers of activity can be observed:
A) Increasing sophistication of top down ESG rating
In recent years, several ratings and certification schemes have been created to assess organisations’ performance
in those matters. These companies provide information to users by cross-checking input from assessed companies
to avoid misleading practices like the greenwashing19. Among the most relevant are the B Corporation Certification,
the Sustainalytics Risk Index, and the Corporate Knights Rating.
▪ The B Corporation Certification (also B Corp) is issued by B Lab, a non-profit organisation, to those
companies that score a minimum of 80 points (out of 200) in an assessment about social and environmental
sustainability. Even though, a B Corp Certification, does not bring any legal significance to the holding
companies, it is globally recognised as a powerful branding tool to build trust in consumers, investors, and
suppliers and to attract and retain employees.
▪ The Sustainalytics Risk Index is issued by the Dutch private firm Sustainalytics to assess companies'
exposure to long-term environmental, social, and governance risks. It is useful both for companies
themselves for targeted marketing programmes, and investors to find potential risks and opportunities
▪ The Corporate Knights Ranking is issued by Corporate Knights, a Canadian financial research firm which
compiles every year starting from 2005 the “Global 100” ranking, a table showing the 100 best performing
companies in terms of ESG based on a set of 43 KPIs.
The process behind the compiling of ESG ratings is typically based on data provided by companies on a voluntary
basis. ESG data aggregators, therefore, start from data which might be partial or biased by the internal perception
of the company supplying them. This first set of information is complemented with additional surveys and sector
analysis studies. Altogether, those data allow aggregators to compile a list of KPIs converging into the ESG rating.
The chart below reports the correlation between different environmental scorings (part of ESG scoring) of a sample
company issued by different providers. The data are shown on a scale from 1 to 0, in which 1 represents a perfect

EU SPACE FOR GREEN TRANSFORMATION
24
correlation (i.e., scores compiled by two different issuers are perfectly identical for a same company) and 0
represents no correlation (i.e., scores compiled by two different ratings have no overlapping consensus for a same
company), it is very evident that the lack of standardisation intrinsic in the described process reduces the
reliability of the rating as a performance indicator.
Exhibit 18: Correlations between environmental scoring issued by different organisations
A process of regulation and standardisation of the environmental monitoring is likely to happen in the next few
years pushed by the already mentioned Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) bringing relevant
business opportunities to those players able to provide reliable and unbiased data. In this context, a clear opportunity
stands for the use of the EU Space Programme as a data provider, both for companies to have a realistic
understanding of their status-quo, and for regulators to monitor the environment and be able to take informed
decisions on measures to be put in place for environment protection. Numerous companies are pushing in this
direction developing products specifically targeted to the ESG parameters assessment. A typical use case provided
by a European start-up is presented in the following use case.
Exhibit 19: Use case - Copernicus for ESG monitoring

With the upcoming regulation about Non-Financial Reporting, ESG rating is now being perceived
as an added factor companies should consider while evaluating their performance. An
independent point of view based on reliable and unbiased data is therefore becoming
fundamental, since there is the need to monitor ESG performance in an impartial way.
EU SPACE FOR GREEN TRANSFORMATION
25
The collection of ESG data is usually reliant on in-situ sensors deployed by the companies
themselves and self-reported data.
This is where space data can play a fundamental role. The Copernicus Programme is one of the
leading contributors to this revolution in ESG monitoring. Companies such as GlobeEye are
addressing the growing needs for unbiased ESG data thanks to space assets. GlobeEye leverages
EO data from different providers, aggregating and analysing them through proprietary AI
algorithms; this allows to provide key insights on crucial parameters such as NOx and particulates
in the interested areas. The role of Copernicus for such data is central and it currently hinges on
Sentinel-5P. Launched in 2017, the
Sentinel-5 Precursor relies on its TROPOMI
payload to monitor several pollutants and
greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere,
such as ozone (O3) and methane (CH4), as
well as carbon, sulphur, and nitrogen oxides
(COx, SOx, NOx). However, the contribution of
Copernicus does not stop here, and it is set to
increase significantly in the coming years
thanks to the upcoming launches of new
satellites. Sentinel-4 and Sentinel-5 are the
first ones and are planned to work in tandem
to complement and expand upon the
capabilities provided by Sentinel-5P. Additionally, further data will be provided by the Expansion
Sentinels, namely the CO2M constellation, which will focus on anthropogenic emissions of CO2.

B) Regulators and investors demanding sustainability information in investment
& financing activities
The European Union has been a pioneer and took steps towards enforcing ESG compliance, initially, starting with
the financial markets: The new EU Sustainable Finance Action Plan introduced a number of key measures which
will come into effect in the EU shortly.
From 2 August 2022, sales agents or distributors authorised in the EU under the MiFID regime must take into
account any sustainability preferences of a client (in addition to the client's investment objectives and risk tolerances)
when assessing the suitability of financial services or products for recommendation. Systematically asking
investors at the outset of the sales process to indicate if they have a preference for ESG products, as envisaged,
could cause a radical shift in the demand levels for ESG products. EU-authorised securities management
companies (UCITS) and fund managers (AIFM) must specifically factor the consideration of sustainability risks into
their investment due diligence processes, risk management processes, and conflicts of interest policies. This will
require the integration of sustainability considerations and factors into firms' investment processes and risk
management processes for all funds managed, not just ESG-focussed funds.
The secondary phase of the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) will crack down on empty
promises and require EU financial products that seek to promote ESG characteristics or have a sustainable
investment objective to make detailed pre-contractual and financial disclosures from 1 January 2023.
In addition, banks are increasingly using ESG ratings to provide access to finance to their clients. For example,
Deutsche Bank is linking the Henkel AG & Co. KGaA (Henkel) supply chain finance program to the ESG ratings of
Henkel's suppliers. Deutsche Bank is the first bank in Europe to convert an existing supply chain finance program
for its client. Through this program, Henkel creates incentives for its suppliers to be more sustainable.
A Henkel’s supplier can receive payment immediately after Henkel approves its invoice. The financing costs for the
suppliers are based on Henkel's creditworthiness, which means that the suppliers can usually lower their typical
financing costs. By improving their ESG rating, suppliers can further reduce financing costs in the supply chain.
Exhibit 22: Media headlines from the last three months (as of July 2022)
C) Corporates embracing ESG as a strategic goal and implementing processes
Corporates have realised that their investors, their customers and future employees are increasingly aware of
ESG. Typically, corporates are professionalising what grew out of corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities
which were typically organised under public relations functions. As the strategic relevance increases with a link to
corporate purpose, the responsibility for ESG is moving closer to the C-level, either through a dedicated
sustainability officer under the CEO or reporting to the CFO. Many corporates create proactive bottom-up efforts
of corporates in shaping their ESG data generation capability. BCG has developed a four-stage evolution that
companies typically go through in shaping their ESG capability.
EU SPACE FOR GREEN TRANSFORMATION
28
Exhibit 23: Four-stage evolution of companies through ESG capabilities (BCG)
These factors are promoting a more in-depth integration of ESG matters in processes and operations of companies.
From our research and interviews with engaged partners, we found two general archetypes of companies talking
the monitoring of KPIs associated with environment in two different ways. A first group to whom we refer as
“Champions” and a second group here referred as “Second Adopters”. Even though both groups are aware of the
importance of environmental monitoring, they differentiate by the level of integration these have in their operations.
Champions are likely to have full integration of environmental monitoring solutions in their operation, Second
Adopters, usually rely on less pervasive solutions such as emissions mathematical models or surveys to be filled
by responsible people across the organization.
D) Growing number of ESG IT solutions – from start-up solutions to fully integrated packages
The ESG system landscape is very wide and varied. On the one end of the spectrum the large Enterprise Resource
Planning (ERP) providers with end-to-end solutions promising to link seamlessly into existing corporate systems.
Their promise is range from supply chain risk and reputation, sustainability management systems, ethical business
operations all the way to integrated reporting and performance management. On the other end, there are numerous
simpler survey or workflow solutions which address parts of the information – often software-as-a-service solutions
from start-ups who see themselves as part of the climate tech or fintech scene.
An example of integration of innovative technology for environmental monitoring and ESG rating is the use of space
data by energy companies to monitor methane emissions into the atmosphere. Sentinel-5P data are particularly
suitable for this application. A detailed use case is provided in the following Exhibit.

▪ Moreover, it sets important goals to ensure a secure and affordable energy supply for EU residences
TotalEnergies to monitor GHG emissions through Copernicus
The energy sector is one of the main contributors to methane emissions, as one-third of the
global anthropogenic ones can be traced back to energy production 22 . Consequently, as
announced in the European methane strategy, the European commission adopted a proposal for
a regulation specifically targeting the reduction of methane emissions in the energy sector. A
central element of this proposal revolves around improved measurement, reporting, and
verification of these emissions. Traditional monitoring techniques for methane emissions are
numerous and each is suitable for specific circumstances23. In case of well-defined origin points,
typical for industrial sites, stack sampling can be used; this involves calibrated bags collecting
samples over time, for them to be later
analysed in laboratories. Tracer gas
dispersion relies on the controlled release
of tracer gases at the point of emission,
with concentration measurements of both
the tracer gas and methane then taken
downwind to monitor methane dispersion;
this technique is often used for livestock
emissions or for wastewater treatment
facilities. Alternatively, enclosure chamber
measurement can be implemented by
deploying either static or dynamic
chamber atop emission points. Finally,
drones equipped with laser beam sensors
can be used for methane monitoring too,
when dealing with pipelines and oil fields.

The capabilities of the EU Space Programme are perfectly suited to complement and improve
traditional methane emissions monitoring techniques. Key players in the fossil fuels industry are

founded almost 100 years ago and employing more than 100,000 people globally. In line with its
long-standing efforts to identify, quantify and reduce methane emissions from its facilities,
TotalEnergies leveraged Copernicus and partnered with Canadian GHGSat to perform a
controlled methane release and validate the contribution of space data to the effective monitoring
of polluting missions within the context of energy production. Enabled by the atmospheric
measurement data coming from Copernicus Sentinel-5P, GHGSat managed to detect the
smallest ever methane emission via satellite, proving the added value that space data can provide
and paving the way to increased adoption of satellite-based monitoring for atmospheric methane
emissions. This would not have been possible without the state-of-the-art capabilities of the
Copernicus programme. Together with its complementary mission Sentinel-4 and, as a precursor
of Sentinel-5, Sentinel-5P has the aim to perform atmospheric measurements with high spatial-
temporal resolution, to be used for air quality, ozone & UV radiation, and climate monitoring &
forecasting. With Sentinel-5, as well as the upcoming satellites of the second generation of
Copernicus, the EU Space Programme is set to play a pivotal role in the green transition of the
energy sector.

will be showcased through conceptual discussion and practical use cases, organised following, when possible, the
structure of the Green Deal action areas as described in the following Exhibit.
3.2.1 Clean energy production and supply
Many initiatives aim to reduce the pollution generated by the constantly increasing power consumption typical in
the modern society, especially using renewable sources. In 2021, electricity generated from renewable sources in
the EU reached a new high of 1068 TWh, a 1% increase (+12 TWh) year-on-year, and a 9% (+88 TWh) increase

Exhibit 26: Energy generation from solar and wind sources in EU2725
The EU Space Programme can make significant contributions to renewable energy providers’ performance,
especially in terms of accessing reliable data for decision-making. Examples include the efficient placement of
renewable energy infrastructure, power infrastructure monitoring and maintenance, and time synchronisation for
electricity grids.
Site choice is among the biggest challenges and predictors in the success of the setup and operation of renewable
energy infrastructure. Many factors play into the decision of the best site for each project and energy source, and
therefore into the final output, efficiency and profitability of the programme. Connections to the grid, historical
weather data (solar irradiance, windspeeds and directions, marine currents, etc.), as well as the oro- and
topographical characteristics are all crucial parameters in this process.
In photovoltaic energy, the amount of solar radiation available and solar panel efficiency depends on several
variables, such as the season, the time of day, the temperature and the geographic latitude; however, the total
available radiation is also affected by clouds, aerosol particles, ozone molecules, and water vapour in the
atmosphere. All these elements interact with the solar radiation absorbing and deflecting it, impacting, therefore,
the efficiency of the power plant.26
Using information gathered from Copernicus’ satellites and atmospheric models, the Copernicus Atmosphere
Monitoring Service produces global irradiation models starting from 2004 until now. Using those models, the
renewable energy sector can make sound decisions on where to best place the solar panels for example. With
similar reasoning, considering the capabilities of Copernicus in monitoring wind and marine currents, it is possible
to build similar applications for the siting of wind turbines and tidal power generation plants. It is estimated that
40 TWh of additional electrical power will be generated thanks to Copernicus until 203027.
Renewable energy
Other than the previous mention application about the correct positioning of renewable energy infrastructure, it is
important to remember that solar panels or wind turbines are generally located in difficult-to-reach places or in
remote locations; solar panels, for instance, are usually placed on high roofs or in remote fields, while wind turbines’
rotors have to be placed several dozens of metres high from the ground. The efficiency of these installations is
directly correlated to their correct maintenance. A build-up of debris on a solar panel can limit its energy output,
while unidentified damage to a wind turbine can have disastrous consequences not only on energy production, but
also on human lives. Copernicus historical weather data from the C3S ERA 5 Reanalysis can help perfect the
cleaning of panels or the maintenance of wind turbines28.

The precise positioning services offered by the EGNSS, together with the latest developments in computer vision-
aided navigation, allow the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in inspection operations, making them quick,
cheap, and dramatically less dangerous for human operators. UAVs have seen successful applications in detecting
solar panel hotspots, a common source of reduction in power generation. Precise GNSS, offered by Galileo and its
upcoming High Accuracy Service, is crucial to making this and future applications efficient.
Oil and gas
Copernicus satellite imagery allows monitoring the full length of oil and gas pipelines, therefore, reliably detecting
potential threats and guiding the rapid response of the emergency services. Sentinel-1’s synthetic aperture radar,
for example, can detect major changes in land surface such as a landslide or earthquake that may damage
infrastructure. Biomass production as a feedstock for biofuels can also be monitored and tracked thanks to
Copernicus and EGNSS.
Smart grids
Energy companies are increasingly using smart grids to improve efficiency and reduce costs. By implementing two-
way communication between smart devices in the field and central data structures, and then linking these to
intelligent analytics, operators gain unprecedented insight into consumption patterns, network performance and
other metrics to ensure optimal operating levels at all times.
The key to this operation is accurate synchronisation between data points. Without it, operators have a limited
ability to extract accurate information from the field or make effective changes to network operations29 This is where
the EGNSS come into play.
EGNSS receivers are relatively cheap, reliable and highly accurate time sources that can be used in large numbers
in smart grids to enable automatic real-time monitoring of the grid. Currently, several projects are developing the
proposed concept and improving its resiliency to tampering.

Copernicus to boost renewable energy growth
A significant amount of the energy produced is assigned to households, which account for around
25% of the total30.
The limited use of roof space over buildings have pushed for the adoption of small solar panel
installations on top of residential buildings. This growth has been very quick, and it forecasted
to continue, with projections showing an increase from 59 GW installed globally in 2021 to almost
95 GW in 202531. However, overall adoption is still limited, with even Italy, one of the leading
European countries, being less than 25%31. One of the reasons for this limited penetration can
be traced back to homeowners simply being unaware of the solar potential of their roofs and
to the challenge in accessing reliable and precise information on the production of solar energy.
NOVELTIS, a French company founded in 1998, found a way to tackle this problem, leveraging
the power of EU Space data. In collaboration with the European Centre for Medium-Range
Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and Copernicus (through CAMS, its Atmosphere Monitoring
System), NOVELTIS has developed Mon Toit Solaire, a service simulating and calculating the
energy potential of photovoltaic rooftop projects and providing users with reliable technical and
financial information. Moreover, it eases the realisation of installation projects by providing
information about local certified professional installers on its website.
Exhibit 28: The Mon Toit Solaire user interface
The contribution of Copernicus
to this service is of paramount
importance. CAMS collects
information about clouds,
water vapour, aerosols, and
ozone levels, and feeds it into a
radiative transfer model to
calculate the amount of solar
irradiation that reaches the
ground. This is then combined
with 3D modelling and
dedicated algorithms, making it
possible to calculate the actual
available roof surface and thus
extrapolating the predicted energy production. The end result is an accessible service that allows
end users to easily understand the economic benefits of rooftop solar installations, facilitating
household adoption and contributing to the green transition.

3.2.2 Clean industry boosting a cleaner industry
The transition into a cleaner European industry will require concerted efforts to address product carbon footprint
and durability simultaneously. On the former, more robust emissions reduction measures in operations will be
needed. Durability, on the other hand, requires proper maintenance and the tools to ensure this is feasible. In this
chapter, we will discuss the impacts EU SPACE can have on clean transport, infrastructure, raw materials extraction
and waste and pollution.
Cleaner industrial operations
Galileo-enabled location-based services can be used throughout the industry to track and optimise operations, such
as in warehousing, bringing direct emissions reductions, as well as linked cost savings.
Galileo will also be instrumental in delivering the electronic product passport – a consumer information tool,
designed to provide valuable information about the origin, composition and durability of a product, based on its
path from sourcing, to production, to retail. Similar principles may be applied in enabling the circular economy, by
providing manufacturers with more reliable and accurate information on the history and quality of recycled materials.
The EU Space Programme is especially well-suited to help unlock fuel efficiencies for the maritime industry,
especially for large vessels such as tanker ships and bulk carriers. Indeed, EGNSS can provide ships with information
for accurate manoeuvring in congested areas, increasing their energy and fuel efficiency. In addition, Earth
observation data and information on currents as well as other factors (e.g., movement of sea ice) can help to optimise
the maritime industry’s fuel efficiency through better routing, thus decreasing emissions and saving costs. Similarly,
the aviation industry can also strongly benefit from the utilisation of EU Space Programme assets for fuel efficiencies
and reduction in emissions. While aviation is the second largest source of greenhouse gases from transport (after
road), the use of EGNOS for safe landing procedures in critical conditions such as fog can enable significant
reductions in the frequency of aborted landings, in turn helping to limit fuel expenditures and emissions.
Lastly, a combination of Copernicus-based planning, and Galileo-enabled operations will facilitate the increased
adoption of the sharing economy. A pertinent example of this is the optimisation of ride-hailing vehicle routes –
including on Uber, Bolt, and many other services33 which help drivers through cost savings, riders through time-
effectiveness, and the greater economy through the resulting reduction in fuel use and emissions. Further resource
reductions are achieved thanks to the optimised fleet management meaning the correct number and type of vehicles,
incorporating traffic congestion and other factors for ideal routes, and checked driving behaviour.
Infrastructure construction and maintenance
Galileo and Copernicus together can help with infrastructure mapping and monitoring and therefore making them
more robust. This can be especially useful for maintaining road infrastructure in rural areas. Disrupted supply chains
can cause loss of products and resources like fuel. Lack of monitoring also makes route optimisation harder, resulting
in inefficiencies. Another use case includes remote sensing in telecommunications industry. Digital elevation
models and land use/land cover can be used to build predictive models for network planning to achieve optimal
network capacity. The presence of necessary data and its quality is critical for accuracy of such models. This is a
relatively cheaper way of satisfying capacity requirements.
Lone workers are employed in a range of industries, but they are at relatively higher risk because of not having
someone to assist or supervise them. In case of an accident, notification of emergency services by a co-worker is
normally necessary. In this context, GNSS is used by different applications to decrease the risk by measuring impacts
and durations of inactivity. Depending on the situation, emergency services are informed of the accident location by
those applications.

Raw materials
It is important, within the context of clean industry, to consider the impacts of raw material extraction, as they are a
highly polluting part of the greater supply chain. Mining, and quarrying, in particular, lie among the most
environmentally harmful activities in this cycle, directly impacting land, water, and air.
Air quality is especially affected by mining operations. Unrefined materials are released when mineral deposits
are exposed to the surface through mining. Wind and vehicular traffic due to mining equipment cause such materials
to become airborne. Lead, arsenic, cadmium, are a non-negligible component of these particulates. These pollutants
can damage the health of people living near the mining site. Diseases of the respiratory system and allergies can be
triggered by the inhalation of such airborne particles.
The modification of the landscape, such as creating open pits and waste deposits can lead to the physical destruction
of the land at the mining site. Furthermore, it can contribute to the deterioration of the area's flora and fauna. There
is also a huge possibility that many of the surface features that were present before mining activities cannot be
replaced after the process has ended. The removal of soil layers and deep underground digging can destabilize the
ground which threatens the future of roads and buildings in the area.
This extreme change in the environment can have a catastrophic impact on the biodiversity of the area. Mining
leads to a massive habitat loss for a diversity of flora and fauna ranging from soil microorganisms to large
mammals34. Considering the current policies for biodiversity preservation, it is vital for companies to understand
the impact of their mining activities to remain competitive.
As of today, the EU accounts for 6% of the world’s population, yet consumes up to 30% of metals produced globally.
This trend is expected to rise to a 63% increase per capita by 206035.
Exhibit 29: Carbon and energy intensity per tonne of metal produced in EU36
Another of the areas in which the EU Space Programme can be beneficial is in the optimisation of fleet management
during mining operations.
It is estimated that the use of precise navigation services can improve the efficiency of mining equipment,
especially trucks, in terms of fuel consumption from 1.8 to 2.3%37.
Furthermore, Galileo-enabled location-based services can be similarly used throughout industry to track and
optimise operations, such as warehousing, bringing direct emissions reductions, leading to cost savings.

EGNSS to improve mining operations
GNSS positioning data is used for example to provide drill monitoring, control and guidance,
allowing to navigate drill rigs with centimetre-level precision without the need for traditional,
time-consuming manual surveys. As a result, optimal fragmentation of rock can be achieved,
which facilitates the subsequent stone extraction and removal activities. Furthermore, accurate
positioning allows to overlap the planned design for the overall mine structure with real-time
vehicles’ position, which can for example be used to offer precise guidance on where ore blocks
are located.
Accurate positioning, however, is not enough. Robustness and resiliency are critical too,
especially in challenging areas.
Companies such as Septentrio, a Belgian manufacturer of GNSS components and receivers
focused on industrial applications such as construction, surveying, robotics, logistics, and
maritime. Septentrio has more than two decades of experience in providing top-of-the-line
products for accurate positioning, and its expertise extends to the mining industry as well.
Septentrio has specifically developed the ARDVAC control system 38 , relying on proprietary
algorithms to improve positioning robustness and resilience during operations. In particular, the
IONO+ algorithm reduces the impact of ionospheric oscillations, while LOCK+ targets signal
robustness during vibrations or shocks and AIM+ protects from radiofrequency interference.
Thanks to the performance of Septentrio’s product line enabled by the capabilities of EGNSS,
mining players relying on these products can ensure maximised efficiency even in the harshest of
environments, achieving not only the highest levels of safety for all operators involved, but also
optimising the utilisation of natural resources and thus safeguarding the integrity of surrounding
ecosystems.

Waste and pollution
The increasing quantities of waste generated in European countries are another challenge to be addressed within
the green transition of industry. It is estimated that Europe produces annually over 800 million of tonnes of waste
per year40. The annual average rate of increase of this waste since 1985 in the OECD European area is estimated at
around 3 per cent. Present disposal and processing capacity is probably not sufficient to deal with the expected
growth, furthermore, existing facilities are often not adequate to ensure acceptable environmental standards41. The
waste related to industries represents 30% of the total European, which results in unnecessary costs to companies.
Since the 1970s, European countries have achieved important progress in reducing emissions into air and water
from production processes by imposing strict emissions standards on conventional pollutants. However, because
of their single-media mandate, environmental
regulations have addressed air and water pollution
problems separately. The result has been to move
pollution problems to the least regulated
environmental medium and the least controlled form
of pollution. The implementation of emission
control technologies has often resulted in
increased amounts of solid waste from production
processes. In addition, the concentration of
hazardous substances in solid residues has increased.
Exhibit 31: Share of waste generated in EU40
One of the most significant impacts of the EU Space
Programme on waste management is the use of
Copernicus in monitoring waste in the oceans. It is
estimated that 4 to 10% of all the recovered waste
from the ocean in operations such as The Ocean
Cleanup 42 or Clean Oceans Project 43 , is directly
accountable to Copernicus44.
Not only reducing waste, but also recycling is a key
measurement for a greener industry. The circular
economy provides a holistic model for reusing, repairing and recycling existing materials and products as long as
possible. The circular economy can benefit from Galileo similarly as with the electronic product passport – a
consumer information tool, designed to provide valuable information about the origin, composition and durability of
a product, based on its path from sourcing, to production, to retail. By providing manufacturers with more reliable
and accurate information on the history and quality of recycled materials, Galileo can be an important benefit for
industries.

3.2.3 Construction and renovation
The EU Space Programme, and Copernicus in particular, are particularly well-placed to offer high-value products
and services to urban planners. The CLMS, providing its land use and land cover capabilities in tandem with the
Copernicus space component, can be complemented with in situ data – including demographic statistics, historical
information, and other layers as pertinent to the application – to enhance informed decision-making in the urban
planning process. In conjunction with EGNSS, Copernicus may be used to create precise location-based action in
urban and rural environments.
A number of the potential applications of Copernicus urban planning data include:
▪ Infrastructure placement and distribution, such as for the allocation of 5G towers – according to land
use/land cover (CLMS) and in situ internet traffic and demographic data
▪ Atmospheric pollution monitoring and management, through CAMS, which may be employed to better-
distribute green spaces and prioritise areas for public transport infrastructure or traffic restrictions (e.g.,
low-emission zones)
▪ Urban heat management, in the identification and remediation of heat islands (e.g., in industrial or business
zones) and providing tools for the design of ventilation and heat absorbing areas
▪ Green space allotment, including for public and business use, to abate the effects of urban pollution, as
well as to improve everyday conditions for citizens and employees

Copernicus for construction monitoring
An important role in the sustainable development of urban environments is related to pre-
emptive maintenance. By timely noticing maintenance needs, the lifespan of buildings can be
increased. While day-to-day servicing can be predicted more easily, the effect of the
surroundings is more difficult to anticipate. An example of a disruptive factor in an environment,
is the construction of the Fereggiano tunnel in Italy (2017). The development of this
infrastructure induces vibrations in the ground that are felt by surrounding buildings. Detektia is a
company that created a tool to assess external effects on existing infrastructure using DinSAR -
essentially combining multiple SAR measurements taken at different times to estimate the
movement of buildings. They then
cluster the movements in categories
to warn the building owners of
potential maintenance requirements.

3.2.4 Smart and sustainable mobility
The EU Space Programme offers a host of solutions for greener transport and mobility in roads, railways, waterways
and airways. Indeed, space-enabled smart mobility has already taken centre stage in Europe’s transport
management system. EU space assets, in particular EGNSS, allow for monitoring of mobility in different networks,
thus contributing to reducing emissions as well as optimising resource usage.
Transportation sector, including land, maritime, and air transport of both passengers and freights, is estimated to
account for 27% of total greenhouse emissions in Europe46. While cars generate the most emissions, aviation has

been responsible for the largest percentage increase in greenhouse gas emissions over 1990 levels (+129 %),
followed by international shipping (+32%) and road transport (+23%)46.
Exhibit 34: Share of transport greenhouse gas emissions in Europe47
Road transport forms the highest proportion of overall transport emissions (72% in 2019 of all EU transport GHG).
However, most of the existing and planned environmental measures in the Member States agenda focus on road
transport, therefore, this share is expected to decrease as road transport decarbonises faster than other transport
modes. The largest increases up to 2030 are projected in the aviation sector, followed by international maritime
transport, as they are not prioritised by national policies. These sub-sectors are therefore expected to constitute a
higher proportion of transport sector emissions in the coming years47.
The road transport sector is already highly populated by GNSS applications which are consistently improving the
performance of vehicles in terms of safety, cost of operation, and sustainability. Galileo information for roads,
such as their geodetic height 48 , can be employed to unlock fuel savings, thus ensuring greener solutions for
transportation vehicles. One such instance is provided by the Galileo-Ecodrive solution, in which actual and
prospective information on road’s geodetic height profile to optimise the operation of auxiliary devices of vehicles.
ESA estimated that for a typical mileage, fuel savings could be in the range of 3-5%, potentially saving up to two
billion litres of fuel per year throughout Europe. Additionally, the use of satellite navigation systems such as Galileo
for vehicles can reduce journey times by more than 10%, which clearly significantly contributes reducing emissions49.

The city of Copenhagen, plans to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025 through a combination of
intelligent public transit systems, electric car-sharing services, and improved city infrastructure for

smart mobility can provide a very significant push for green transportation and green cities at
large. Transportation systems are estimated to account for 64% of global oil consumption and
27% of global energy use.51
Space data, including both remote sensing and navigation, is essential to unlock the great
benefits deriving from smart mobility solutions. Several examples of (European) companies
supporting the development of the smart mobility industries exist. One such instance is TernowAI.
The company extensively employs remote sensing data from various sources including SAR
imagery from Sentinel-1 in support of autonomous driving solutions. TernowAI develops various
products highly relevant to autonomous vehicles through the processing of remote sensing data:

of both AeroSat Vector and HD maps. The former is based upon the processing of remote sensing
data through proprietary algorithms to generate vector-based maps in lower resolution. In
contrast, for the latter the company processes Earth observation images with artificial intelligence
processes to entirely avoid the need for in-situ images. HD maps are amongst the key components
of the infrastructure supporting widespread autonomous driving; these include information
about the exact positions of various significant features of the urban landscape such as
pedestrian crossing, traffic lights and signs, barriers and several others. In essence, most if not
all autonomous car manufacturers have recognised the need for onboard HD maps for any
autonomous vehicle for both safety reasons as well as for driver and passenger comfort.
Companies such as TernowAI, integrating Earth observation imagery with AI processes, are well-
positioned to meet this market need.

Copernicus for road infrastructure management
The traditional approach for road infrastructure building and maintenance does not rely on space
data, being instead based on in-situ observations.
Space data can help addressing road maintenance, making road assessments cheaper and
easier to perform on a large scale thanks to regular observations allowing the development
of periodically updated, country wide InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) maps
including Sentinel-1 data. In turn, these analyses can then be already leveraged in the planning
phases, optimising route design and reducing associated costs. The economic benefits of this
paradigm shift enabled by Earth Observation satellites are estimated at almost €20 million for
example for the Italian company ANAS alone.
These benefits, however, are not merely economic. More efficient highway management reflects
on the surrounding environment as well. On the one hand, not having to repeatedly modify
designs and routes limits the impact of construction works, both in terms of the emission
generated by construction activities as well as the modifications introduced in the
geomorphological landscape. On the other, periodic monitoring using InSAR can help in
identifying and mitigating any impact on, for example, local farms caused by induced changes in
underground water flows and aquifer levels.
In the future, the creation of larger archives of data thanks to InSAR will allow to analyse sites
retrospectively. Additionally, the launch of new SAR satellites will increase both the resolution
and the revisit times. This will make it possible to offer semi real-time monitoring that could be
very useful during extreme-meteorological events, for faster response and for failure prediction
purposes.
As for the aviation sector, one of the main challenges is traffic management. Delays in planes' schedules create the
necessity of prolonging the effective time planes have their engines running idle on the ground. In this context,
EGNSS can come to help. There are projects aimed at using satellite navigation to reduce these delays through
artificial intelligence algorithms analysing ground traffic data54.

EGNSS for airport ground equipment management
Large airports are complex hubs where logistics and consumer experience come together. The
logistical challenges faced by airport staff and airliners are highly complex and require advanced
tools to deal with these adequately. On the other hand, airports must consider the consumer
experience: the walking distance from a gate to another, waiting time between flights, etc.
From an environmental perspective, delays induce increased air pollution due to aeroplanes
having to idle for longer at the gate with running engines while waiting for ground equipment
to arrive. Since jet engines require some time to warm up prior to flight, it is common practice to
keep engines running at gates. This is a wasteful practice to be able to clear the gate as soon as
on-boarding is finished, and clearance is granted.
Blue Dot Solutions is a company that developed a service focusing on reducing the occurrence of
delays and limit the consequent additional air pollution and passenger frustrations. Their Ground

satellites. DMI relies on both optical and radar imagery, as well as thermal infrared satellite
data (e.g., AVHRR) and microwave radiometers (e.g., AMSR2) and altimeters. The main benefits
of Copernicus data are the result of the satellite’s capability to capture large areas in very short
time, providing higher and faster coverage than traditional in-situ measurements. The constant
monitoring allows to identify evolving ice dynamics and, therefore, to optimise ship’s routes
around ice formations and identify when new, better lanes become available.
While this service provides important economic benefit to Greenland, around €10 million per year,
a crucial contribution pertains to environmental benefits. Route optimisation allows to save fuel
and even in the event of having to resort to longer routes, being able to avoid changing travel
plans at the last-minute results in a net positive impact, thus making sea transport more
sustainable. Furthermore, reliable and frequent satellite data can help prevent accidents and oil
spills, safeguarding the integrity of the Arctic ecosystem. It is crucial to note that these benefits
are compounded by the importance of Greenland and of polar ice in the overall context of
climate change. The melting of frozen water reservoirs captured by the thick ice covering
Greenland’s landmass will have a profound effect on global sea levels, endangering millions of
people across the globe. Moreover, the island’s ice sheets are trapping significant amounts of
methane: the release of this gas in the atmosphere because of increasing global temperatures
would further compound the greenhouse effect, exacerbating an already critical situation.

Another use case for maritime is weather forecasting in the maritime environment. This is supported by collecting
meteorological data and location data from the ships on the move. More accurate knowledge of the real conditions
that this system will provide can lead to improvements to safety and fuel usage.
EUSPA has actively funded the Prepare-Ships Project to support the development of a robust navigation application,
integrating EGNSS and EO data through machine-learning processes to accurately predict the future positioning of
nearby vessels. Besides ensuring safety at sea by decreasing collision risks, applications such as those developed
within the scope of Prepare-Ships will facilitate energy-effective manoeuvring and route-optimisation, significantly
reducing the environmental impact of maritime transportation.
3.2.5 A healthier and greener food system
Tackling green agriculture is a task on many fronts. Precision agriculture and better enforcement of agro-
environmental policies underpin the response that is meant to lead the sector into a 50% reduction of chemicals
used, and climate neutrality by 2035. The use of digital technologies in agriculture is helping the whole sector
improve its performance and become greener.
The necessity for efficiency and sustainability of agricultural production is growing. Companies are highly aware of
the importance of enhancing productivity without harming the environment, and, therefore, are continually looking
for means to achieve this. In this context, the EU Space Programme is a key asset in supporting agricultural
businesses to reduce costs and improve quality of goods, while ensuring sustainable practices.
The synergy between Galileo signals, Copernicus data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) based techniques facilitates
the operation of both crewed and uncrewed vehicles – aerial and land-based – for optimised farming. Copernicus
imagery provides the foundations for digital field models, including the identification of boundaries with other plots,
the mapping and evolution of crops and invasive species. These may then be fed into AI algorithms to determine

Copernicus for crop monitoring in BelgiumPotato cultivation in central Europe has enlarged to
such an extent over the last decades that any further switch from any crop to potatoes is very
likely to result in soil degradation and soil depletion. Thus, a higher output and growth can only
be reached through an improvement in the efficiency of agricultural land utilisation. Potato fields
in Belgium today achieve an output around 50 tonnes per hectare, but maximum output is
expected to be double than that, around 100 tonnes/ha. This higher supply can only result from
better, more sustainable and more effective farm management practices. An ulterior factor playing
a significant role is climate and the consequent weather: unexpected changes in the weather
Space data can play a central role in potato industry, both in helping it become more efficient to
meet upcoming challenges as well as in providing it with the necessary tools to face the effects
of climate change. As a matter of fact, it is already doing so. VITO, a Flemish independent research
organization in the field of cleantech and sustainable development, has developed in cooperation
with Belgapom a Copernicus-based service called WatchITgrow58, entirely dedicated to the
Belgian potato industry. WatchITgrow is a geo-information platform relying on data from both
Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 which can provide potato farmers, agronomists, traders and processors
with data and information on the growth of different potato varieties. Complementing this space-
based dataset with information from other satellites, drones, weather and soil measurements, this
service offers extensive support to the potato sector, including information on the state and
growth of crops, yields and harvest dates estimates, as well as enabling the improvement of
yields and reducing production and quality losses.

Future developments are set to provide even
more benefits. Thanks to an increase in the
quantity and quality of data available,
together with the capabilities introduced by
new generation of satellites, it will be possible
to provide farmers with recommendations on
nitrogen fertilisation – thus also generating
positive environmental impact –, as well as
warnings for irrigation scheduling and even
major diseases such as late blight. Not only
will this unlock new economic benefits, but
also it will provide significant environmental
impact: Copernicus will enable greener and
healthier food by optimising the use of
pesticides, making sure they are used only when and where necessary and thus reducing the
excess fertilizer not taken up by the plants and, therefore, the excess nutrients which run-off into
surface-water channels contaminating water supplies.

Enabled by the large availability of space data, especially EGNSS, precision agriculture is helping to support
improvement of production of crops and the green transformation. The first benefit of this practice is the water saved
in agriculture, which accounts for 4% of water saved per year60. Moreover, thanks to precision agriculture and space
data in general, it is possible to save up to 9% of pesticides and 7% of fertilisers60. Another important factor to
consider is the fuel consumption for all the activities related to agriculture, which precision agriculture is estimated
to reduce by 6%60. As a result of those improvements, in 2022, precision agriculture is estimated to have a huge
economic and sustainable impact on the sector, growing considerably in the next years.

Copernicus for water management in the food industry Space data can play a pivotal role in
addressing the water challenges of the beer industry, as proven by Heineken, the number one
brewer in Europe and one of the largest in the world. Heineken’s brewery in Zoeterwoude, a
municipality in the Netherlands, uses local river water for its needs. The water is stored and purified
by the dunes in South Holland before reaching the facility where it can be used in the brewing
process. To improve the water management in its area, this Heineken brewery partnered with the
University of Wageningen creating the Green Circles cooperative.
Thanks to this collaboration, Heineken can combine satellite observations with meteorological data
and the results of other biophysical analyses to forecasts floods and droughts, thus obtaining
valuable information to improve water resource management. Wageningen Environmental
Research and Climate Adaptation Services leveraged a wide range of data to create "story maps",
combining GIS maps and artist impressions.
Using these, the Green Circles partners can easily plan a more responsible approach to business
and environmental development. The Copernicus Climate Change Service proved extremely
valuable in providing prototype water indicators, one of the most comprehensive and up-to-date
climate change resources. These data can be mapped graphically, thus helping the wider
community to understand the impact at a pan-European level, and are a critical add-on to local
data, such as meteorological information and observation from in situ stations. It is important to
note that, with this data, Wageningen Environmental Research has been able to develop accurate
forecasts of water flows, which allowed Heineken Netherlands to act, improving its water
management and reducing its environmental impact. Furthermore, it also fostered the birth of new
spin-off projects. For example, Heineken invested in the creation of marshland to naturally
purify the wastewater from the brewery, as natural purification costs less, has ecological benefits,
creates a pleasant environment, and will provide a store of water in times of drought.
Copernicus can also be used to then monitor and enforce performance-based agriculture. Farmers are provided
with a measure of how their crops are performing, while also having access to historical data as well as forecasts
on how the future performance is likely to be. Rewarding systems – such as the one enforced by the Agoro Carbon
Alliance 62 are enabled by satellite imagery. Previously, aerial or manual, land-based surveying was necessary,
rendering these systems very costly, and in certain instances infeasible in the more sparsely populated countryside.
The open and free nature of Copernicus data allows for these systems to be put in place to more easily and

effectively enforce the agricultural policy. The monitoring of the growth and evolution of invasive alien species, as
well as illegal practices in agriculture, is also directly enabled by similar systems.
Soil is of course of critical importance for the health and sustainability of crops and their products, and in addition
provides invaluable ecosystem services such as ensuring the cleanliness of water, supporting biodiversity and
helping to regulate climate. EO data from Copernicus in conjunction with ground measurements (e.g., from the Land
Use/Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS) soil monitoring system) provide key data and information for
the monitoring and verification of soil conditions, which in turn can support analyses on the health of crops and
food. Also, EGNSS and Copernicus can provide early warnings for natural disasters and increase food security
further.
Copernicus data and products developed by CAMS and C3S can not only benefit climate action within the
agricultural sector but can also be used to ensure food security. Indeed, CAMS monitors the concentration of
carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane among other greenhouse gases, 23% of which are estimated to be
emitted as a result of human activities in agriculture and forestry. Agriculture is a particular case for climate action
as it not only contributes to emissions of greenhouse gases, but also helps their mitigation and their uptake as crops
and other vegetation act as sinks. As such, C3S created the Sectoral Information System for Global Agriculture to
allow the sector to adapt to the changes brought by climate change, ensuring that crop yields in critical areas remain
consistent as well as allowing for efficiencies to be unlocked, thus helping to reduce the impact of the agricultural
sector on the environment.63
Livestock management is another dimension that EO and GNSS can improve. Selecting an ideal grazing area is
important. Likewise, sustainable livestock reproduction is facilitated by GNSS and EO.
Galileo is also to be further used in a similar fashion to the electronic product passport, to establish a food passport.
This would provide consumers with reliable, traceable information about the origin and path of a food product from
‘Farm to Fork’, adding another beneficial food safety dimension to the existing system, and promoting more
nutritious food, for healthier lifestyles. At the same time, from the farmer's perspective, this adds value to the
product being produced. Furthermore, data and information from EO and GNSS can be coupled with innovative
technologies such as blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), both of which are considered to have
great potential in the agricultural sector. The application of these technologies can ensure the traceability of foods
from source to consumer, ensuring their immutability and auditability.

Copernicus for aquifer monitoring
The term “aquifer” 64 refers to an underground layer of rock or sediment capable to absorb and
hold water permeating through the soil. Groundwater extracted from aquifers is an invaluable
resource, with demand growing due to the need for potable water and households, irrigation for
agriculture, and industry. When this demand exceeds available supply, the resulting
environmental damage can be extremely serious and can lead to land subsidence (i.e., the gradual
settling or sudden sinking of land surface due to underground movements). Furthermore, the
extensive exploitation and the resulting pollution make it so that only 1% of all freshwaters
(including both aquifers and surface sources) is available for direct use.It is therefore evident that
effective and appropriate management of aquifers is indispensable for sustainable use and long-
term availability of groundwater. This is the case, for example, for the Spanish region of Murcia
where the policies related to groundwater are impacted by the European Water Framework
Directive (WFD) and implemented by CHS, the regional River Basin Authority. Leveraging
traditional methods, CHS has deployed over the years an extensive network of ground stations to
measure piezometric levels of water pressure and estimate water levels in aquifers. EU Space
Data has played a role in this field for several years now, thanks to the use of GNSS-enabled
ground stations. This has widely improved the data collection process, making it more reliable
and more easily performed than in the past.
Example of
real-life
use case
Copernicus Sentinel-1 SAR data can provide all-weather, day-night capability to accurately
detect and measure ground observations. The observation allows to compare the images at
different points in time and thus compute ground deformations up to a few millimetres.
Additionally, the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) can provide consistent data regarding
ground displacements.
Exhibit 45: Satellite map of ground
deformation
As a result, aquifer management becomes
more efficient, with a plethora of
environmental benefits as a consequence.
Optimising water extraction can help prevent
ground subsidence and reduce, or even avoid,
aquifer depletion. Additionally, space data-
based decision-making can play a central role
in maintaining river levels above those
thresholds that would impact ecosystems
and protected natural spaces. Moreover,
satellite data can also contribute to quickly
identifying and thus preventing saltwater
infiltration in the aquifer, which degrades the
quality of the water and affects agricultural soil. Furthermore, satellite monitoring can even go
beyond, for example allowing to track the stability of mining waste dumps and playing a role in
preventing the contamination of groundwater from polluting chemicals.
Companies, such as Detektia monitor ground water dynamics and slope stability using DInSAR
and InSAR technology. Detektia transforms the information provided by satellites into digital
solutions for infrastructure management.

3.2.6 Restored ecosystems and biodiversity
Climate change has impacted global biodiversity as well as ecosystems and will continue to be one of the leading
drivers of biodiversity loss in the 21st century. Such a threat to the natural environment requires proportionate action
in the management of ecosystems through conservation and restoration.
The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) provides operational climate indicators that help properly assess
and manage biodiversity loss. Implemented by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
(ECMWF) on behalf of the European Commission, the centre provides climate data and information on a range of
sectoral areas affecting ecosystems and biodiversity (i.e., climate change, marine and land conditions).
In particular, there are climate-biodiversity indicators developed within the Sectoral Information System (SIS),
which assist in assessing the impact of temperature, rainfall and other atmospheric, terrestrial or oceanic variables
on habitat suitability, species distribution and species fitness and reproduction. The indicators can be used for
biodiversity and ecosystem service assessments for both fauna and flora, in the terrestrial as well as the marine
biosphere, for different climatic zones around the globe. The SIS for Global Biodiversity offers a flexible, generic
platform providing global users with access to key information. Importantly, SIS can provide support for decision-
makers mitigating the current lack of relevant climate data. Indeed, policymakers, scientists, nature conservation
agencies, landowners, private companies etc. all over the world are currently using this data to inform their decision-
making process on issues impacting their direct business and society at large.
As a tangible example of data-driven change, a country renowned for its pristine nature and sustainability is Costa
Rica, whose development goals are directly linked to biodiversity. Because of the scarcity of consistent and reliable
national data, the country relies on data from the C3S Climate Data Store which is used in conjunction with local
station data to provide a baseline for downscaled and calibrated climate data and basic biodiversity indicators
that could be projected into the future.
The results pulled from the data showed that the temperature and precipitation will likely increase by 2040 along
with a potential shift in biodiversity resulting from the rise in temperature. Moreover, it helped facilitate the Costa
Rican government’s decision-making regarding a crucial policy topic. All in all, this use case showcases the central
role that Copernicus data can play in monitoring, assessing, managing and mitigating biodiversity and ecosystem
services. Additionally, the results can be used to inform adaptive measures which will increase the resilience of the
country’s ecosystems.
Support for biodiversity protection policies is also provided by the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring
Service (CMEMS), working to preserve marine biodiversity worldwide. Once again, the data offered to decision-
makers allows for data-driven, holistic strategies to be implemented. Within the European frameworks, CMEMS
data is used to support the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the EU Biodiversity Strategy and the EU Habitat
Directive. Concrete examples of the use of Copernicus data for the Marine Strategy Framework Directive are the
improvement of eutrophication assessments through the leveraging of ocean colour data, as well as data on ocean
currents allowing the tracking of and response operations for oil spill drifts. Furthermore, EU decision-makers, as
well as national and local administrators, use several different variables monitored by CMEMS (e.g., low and mid
trophic levels biomass, ocean colour, ocean temperature, etc.) in order to implement the EU’s Biodiversity Strategy
as set out in the European Green Deal.
Many relevant examples can be found in the industry. Leading companies in the renewable energy segment – wind,
due to the risk of bird strikes, and solar due to high land take, in particular – are beginning to integrate biodiversity
action into their ESG strategy. This may involve targets for biodiversity loss minimisation, and even species
reintroduction in harmony with the developed energy projects. In agriculture, also, increases in efficiencies allow for
cooperatives and associations to engage in similar initiatives, thanks to the subsequently decreased land take and
thus more areas available for biodiversity preservation. A combination of EGNSS-based tracking (e.g., for protected
aviary species or similar), and Copernicus data and information used for vegetation/forestry planning and monitoring,
as well as habitat management can enable such initiatives. Use cases of tracking also include predicting conservation
hot-spots, identifying human-animal interaction zones, sustaining productive fisheries and understanding spread of
diseases.
EU SPACE FOR GREEN TRANSFORMATION
53
Another relevant application to which Copernicus contributes is the monitoring of pipelines. In general, early
pipeline leak detection tends to be difficult due to the vast geographic area affected, if not quickly contained they
can lead to severe environmental impacts ranging from oil pollution to unwanted methane gas emissions.
Forests are another key asset and host of biodiversity for Europe, not only for resource generation, but also as a
green lung for the European population. In 2020, the EU had an estimated 159 million hectares of forests. This
area has increased by almost 10% since 1990 (145 million hectares). In five EU Member States, more than half of
the land area was covered with forests: Finland (66%), Sweden (63%), Slovenia (61%), Estonia (54%) and Latvia
(53%)66.
Earth Observation data provide forest authorities with accurate forest mapping, usable for storm damages
assessment, inventory and validation of forest strands for wood purchasers. Thanks to time series of satellite images
forest authorities are also able to detect a change in the land cover/land use in forest areas like illegal clear cut for
example, or urban areas expansion threatening the ecosystem. These instruments appear to be even more important
if considering that in the EU more than 60% of forests are privately owned67.

Forests account for most of Earth’s terrestrial biodiversity, covering 31% of the global land area;
they supply water, provide livelihoods (over 90% of those living in extreme poverty are dependent
on forests), help mitigate climate change and are key to the production of sustainable food.
However, the health of forests has been and continues to be threatened by deforestation and
degradation. Between 2015 and 2020, approximately 10 million hectares per year were lost due
to deforestation, about 0.25% of the total forest land area. In this context, the EU agreed law to
fight global deforestation and forest degradation driven by EU production and
consumption through the provisional political agreement just reached between the European
Parliament and the Council on an EU Regulation on deforestation-free supply chains.68
For instance, Satelligence uses optical and radar satellite data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-
2, both archived and recent, to generate the Forest Loss Risk Index. This incorporates accurate
forest and other land cover and deforestation information, enabling the identification of risks in

satellite data is integrated with supply chain data stored in an up-to-date database of million so
geolocated farms, concessions, factories, and other key locations. Satelligence can thus provide
key insights on performance of agricultural production and supply chain risks linked with
deforestation.

were not complying with the boundaries of the cut area or were not as they were supposed to be. Clear-cut areas
in Europe account for about 10% of the total forest area 72 (i.e., 16 million hectares). Copernicus is expected to
contribute from 2% to 10% of the spotted non-compliant areas. This in the worst-case scenario means that
Copernicus contributed to saving 32 k hectares of forest only in 2022. Considering that each hectare of forest
stores 750 tonnes of CO2 and contributes to absorbing 90 tonnes of CO2 per year, Copernicus is directly accountable
for saving about 27 million tonnes of CO2 per year. On a global scale, Copernicus is already a crucial tool for
innovation happening in the voluntary carbon market’s monitoring, reporting, and verification.

Copernicus for tourism impact assessment
Tourism is a crucial sector in today’s world, and it plays a central role both at EU and global level.
Considering the economics behind it, 3.9% of EU’s GDP in 2018 can be traced back to tourism,
and this figure rises significantly (10.3%) when also considering its impact on adjacent sectors.73
However, this increase in tourism is also related to negative environmental impact. Potential
adverse effects of tourism development relate to three main areas: strain on natural resources,
pollution, and physical impacts, typically involving the degradation of ecosystems.
Reducing the impact of tourism-related activities and making the whole sector more resilient is
therefore imperative, and EU space data can play a central role in this regard. One of the many
companies aware of the enabling role of satellite data is Murmuration, a Toulouse-based
company focusing on providing services in the domains of tourism, green tech, and renewable
energies. Its STI project in particular aims to create an industrial system to measure and assess
in detail the environmental impact of tourism, and it hinges on observation data provided by
Copernicus through WEkEO, one of the Copernicus DIASs. The key contribution of space data
pertains to the development of the key indicators underpinning this assessment system, indicators
that span five different categories. Air indicators consider the effect on Earth’s atmosphere and
include Aggregate Air Quality, Super Resolution Air Quality, and Air Pollutants. Biodiversity
indicators focus instead on the health of ecosystems and consider vegetation health, vegetation
classification, forest cover, protected areas, and endangered species. Human activities indicators
focus specifically on the effect of tourism on the environment, considering tourism and road
infrastructure as well as tourist flows. Finally, ground indicators include soil sealing, land
occupation and urban heat, while water indicators consider both water quality and aquatic
coverage.

4. CONCLUSIONS: EU SPACE
FOR GREEN TRANSFORMATION
In the context of a more sustainable society and ESG scoring, companies are setting green transformation targets to
reduce greenhouse emissions and environmental footprint of their operations, as well promote their actions to
attract customers and increase their market shares. Business benefit from a myriad of possible applications for
EU space data, which translates into not only greener practices, but also cost reduction and increased efficiency.
In a path to decarbonisation of energy resources, the Green Deal proposes a transition to renewable sources. Such
businesses can be significantly supported by Galileo and Copernicus data, especially in decision-making. First, the
evaluation of infrastructure placement can be enhanced by Copernicus data on wind velocity and direction, solar
radiation and more. Moreover, EGNSS offers precise positioning, useful in inspection operations to save time and
costs, as well as reliable timing and synchronisation to tune smart electricity grids.
The Green Deal goal of a greener industry can be supported by the EU space programme. Galileo devices enables
tracking of products and optimisation of operations throughout their life cycle, resulting in reduced emissions.
Moreover, it supports the creation of an electronic product passport, containing relevant information for the
consumer. As regards to raw materials, Copernicus provides essential data on availability, geology, biology and
ecology. In special for mining operations, Copernicus Earth Observation images supports activities from mining
survey to site clean-up, rehabilitation and waste management. In the matter of waste production reduction and
management, EO can monitor water, creating significant insights into plastic production and recycling.
A green urban development relies on solid data. Infrastructure placement, atmospheric pollution monitoring,
urban heat management and green place allotment are some of the many applications of Copernicus imagery in
urban planning that reinforce the goals of the EU Green Deal.
EGNSS has a fundamental role in reducing greenhouse emissions, consonant to the Green Deal’s ambitions. Aiming
a smart and sustainable mobility, Galileo is a key tool for reducing travel time and fuel consumption, leading to
lower costs and lower emissions. It can be used for path optimising in several transportation sectors, as route,
aviation and marine, bringing important profits to companies. Moreover, Copernicus produces information on ocean
streams strength and direction, as well as weather forecasting, improving safety and fuel usage.
Satellite data provided by Copernicus and Galileo play a key role in improving the food system, developing
sustainable and efficient practices. The EU space data enables precision agriculture by mapping the evolution of
crops and precisely navigating to the intervention areas. Copernicus information on soil moisture and crop
development improves irrigation efficiency, fertilisation and pesticide usage, detection and localisation of crop health
issues and more. Moreover, EGNSS data is imperative for automatic steering of agriculture machinery, enabling rout
planning and optimisation, which results in reduced soil damage and fuel consumption.
Ecosystems and biodiversity preservation are vital for the maintenance of life on Earth. In this respect, Copernicus
data is especially appropriate for monitoring the environment, providing crucial climate-biodiversity indicators.
To fight against biodiversity loss, Copernicus data may be also used for early identification of maintenance issues in
oil and gas pipelines, preventing harmful consequences to the environment of a late leak detection. Further
applications for biodiversity and ecosystem monitoring are broad; Copernicus gives users a better understanding of
deforestation, forest fires, soil degradation, floods, coral reef bleaching and more.
The exhibit below contextualises the contribution of EU Space for green transformation from a business model
perspective with a focus on supporting environmental monitoring and impact reduction.

Exhibit 49: Business model canvas
Despite this enormous potential of EU Space data use for Green Transformation, the industry consultation showed
a clear lack of awareness of this applicability.
Exhibit 50: Summary of the results of stakeholder consultations (interviews and survey)
Almost all the consulted companies (direct interviews and surveys) stated that they are currently not leveraging EU
Space Data for pursuing their green transformation objectives. However, many expressed their interest to know
more about it and possibly being engaged by EUSPA in further action. The European Commission and EUSPA are
committed to support the small businesses and corporates in understanding and implementation of the Space data
in their process of green transformation. This report is the first step in this journey.

ANNEX 1: ABOUT THE EUROPEAN GLOBAL
NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND COPERNICUS
A.1 About the European Global Navigation Satellite System
(EGNSS)
The EGNSS component of the EU Space Programme has been the cornerstone of positioning and timing operations
since its introduction, supporting activities spanning from transport, to search and rescue, and trading. It consists of
two components:
▪ Galileo, the European Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), operational since December 2016 when it
started offering initial services to public authorities, businesses, and citizens.
▪ EGNOS, the European Satellite-Based Augmentation System (SBAS), that improves the accuracy of GNSS
signals.
The strengths of Galileo lie in its high accuracy, its reliability for timing and positioning, as well as its advanced
authentication system. While the EGNSS provides global positioning and timing, it is a particularly important tool
for Europe’s long-term strategic non-dependence from services provided by non-European assets like the US GPS,
as well as control over its space-based infrastructure. Galileo stands out as the only civilian GNSS service in the
world.
Galileo currently offers three services: the Open Service (OS), a free mass-market service for positioning, navigation
and timing, the Search and Rescue (SAR) service, Europe’s contribution to the international distress beacon locating
organisation COSPAS-SARSAT both operational since 2016, and the Public Regulated Service (PRS), a fully
encrypted and robust service for authorised security and governmental users in EU Member States. In addition,
Galileo is set to offer other major service lines including the Galileo Open Service Navigation Message
Authentication (OSNMA) – free and open with authentication capabilities, the High Accuracy Service (HAS) –
designed to deliver further signal, encryption and value-added services to commercial users75.
Exhibit 51: Galileo services
EGNOS is a satellite-based augmentation system, originally designed to enhance the Global Positioning System
(GPS) signal for safety-of-life operations. EGNOS provides across all EU Member States high-accuracy, high-
integrity services for aviation, maritime and land-based users where raw GNSS information is insufficient.
Specifically, as of 2022, EGNOS uses three geostationary satellites and an extensive ground station network to
provide three services: the Open Service (OS) – used for non-safety-critical applications; the Safety of Life Service
(SOLS) – for navigation where human lives are at stake; and the EGNOS Data Access Service (EDAS) – a ground-
based data access point for information collected by EGNOS.

The EGNSS value chain comprises three major segments: space- and ground-based infrastructure in the upstream
(1), system integrators (2), and devices and value-added service providers in the downstream (3). Downstream
actors vary more widely, with the primary differentiators being their area of specialisation and expertise in specific
verticals, such for instance agriculture, energy, transport, etc., all of which have a different operating landscape.
A.2 About Copernicus – the EU Earth Observation programme
Copernicus is the EU’s Earth Observation (EO) programme that provides satellite data and information freely
and openly to users. The Sentinel satellites consist of a series of different missions providing global coverage of
radar, multispectral, atmospheric chemistry and altimetry data, with additional missions to follow. What started as
the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme in 1999 is now an operational system, seen
by many observers as one of the world’s largest EO providers and an enormous utility for the benefit of Europe and
the world.
The Copernicus programme features six primary service lines including atmosphere, marine environment, land
monitoring, climate change, security and emergency management, which provide ready-to-use Copernicus-based
analyses and information in a variety of domains, in Europe and abroad. Copernicus services are based on
information from the Sentinels (core Copernicus satellites) as well as tens of third-party satellites known as
Contributing Missions, complemented by in-situ (meaning on-site non-space) data.
Exhibit 52: Copernicus services
The combined capabilities of Copernicus data and information ensure European autonomous access to
environmental knowledge and technologies, supporting the Union’s decision-making in areas such as
environmental policy, climate change, maritime, agriculture, rural development, the preservation of cultural heritage,
civil protection, land and infrastructure monitoring, security as well as the digital economy, among others76.
A key component of the Copernicus system is its data policy that makes most of its satellite data and services
available on a full, open, and free-of-charge basis.
Copernicus data are delivered to their users through a variety of online data access platforms77, such as the ESA-
managed Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem which was inaugurated in January 2023, and the EUMETSAT-managed
76 Source: Copernicus website
77 Refer to: Copernicus - Access to Data for further information

EUMETCast platform78. In addition to the above platforms, several Copernicus Services have developed their own
online platform, which provide users with access to information and forecasting products, associated documentation
and support services for their use (1000+ Copernicus products are available to users in total).
To fully tap the potential of Copernicus data, in 2017, the European Commission launched the development of five
cloud-based platforms: the Copernicus Data and Information Access Services (DIAS). Each DIAS provided access
in a virtual environment to all Copernicus data and information, as well as tools and utilities to process them in the
cloud without having to download massive amounts of data. Building on the experience gained with the launch of
the DIASes, a new Copernicus data access service, referred to as the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem79, has been
launched in January 2023. Such service is part of part of the Copernicus activities delegated by the European
Commission to the European Space Agency and aim at harmonising and streamlining the Copernicus Data Access
framework through a single platform to better access and exploit the Copernicus Data. The new service will be fully
operational in July 2023 after a progressive phase-in period corresponding to the phasing out of the current data
distribution service, leaving time for users to migrate and familiarise themselves with the new service interfaces 80.
In parallel, Eumetsat, ECMWF, Mercator Ocean International and EEA operate the WEkEO cloud-based platform81
which provides access to a variety of Sentinel data and to products and information from the Copernicus
Atmosphere, Ocean and Land Monitoring and Climate Change Services.
This policy is already stimulating the application of digital technology and geospatial intelligence in institutions and
businesses and helps to foster the role of “soft power” of the EU internationally.
Copernicus provides about 8 Petabytes of open and free data per year to citizens, businesses and governments
across Europe. As with EGNSS, a significant part of Copernicus’s value chain lies with added-value service
providers, who adapt, process and redistribute specialised data from the full, open set. Information from Copernicus
is also often augmented with in-situ observation, such as from aerial, water-based or ground-based sensor
information, providing further, higher-fidelity and higher-value information to end-users. Other added-value
services include data analysis, integration with supplemental sources, and validation.
Future evolutions of the Copernicus Programme include six Sentinel Expansion missions especially designed to
address EU policy and gaps in Copernicus user needs and to expand the current capabilities of the Copernicus Space
Component82. The Copernicus Sentinel expansion missions will provide new and enhanced information helping to
tackle challenges such as food security, water management, sea level, polar ice, urbanization and climate change82.
