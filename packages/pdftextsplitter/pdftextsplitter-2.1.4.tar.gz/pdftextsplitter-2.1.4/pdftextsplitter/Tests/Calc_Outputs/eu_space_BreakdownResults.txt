Dear reader, climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing humanity today – and overcoming it requires not only an evolution in the way we live our lives, but also a green modification on how we do business. Driving this transformation is the European Green Deal, which strives to drastically reduce carbon emissions, increase sustainable practices and, ultimately, make Europe the world’s first climate-neutral continent by 2050. But achieving these goals requires that companies take a deep look at their internal operations, and supply chains to identify opportunities for reducing their own environmental footprint.

In December 2019, the European Commission announced the European Green Deal, a package of policies and initiatives to answer the United Nation’s 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. This ambitious roadmap towards a climate-resilient society aspires to make the European Union’s economy sustainable, turning climate and environmental challenges into opportunities. The Green Deal is designed to transform Europe into the first climate-neutral continent, achieving zero net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050. As tighter regulation and legislation appear on the horizon and purchasing and investment patterns place ever- higher importance on sustainability, companies embark on their sustainability journey.

Climate change is one of the biggest challenges of humanity and its severe impacts to society are just beginning to emerge. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by human activities e.g., manufacturing, transport, energy production and distribution, agriculture are the most accountable to this phenomenon. Exhibit 3: Greenhouse gas emissions global and by sector To overcome climate change in the long term, we must drastically reduce anthropogenic emissions and encourage a strong shift towards sustainability and green transformation. In this context, much importance is given to our transition to a more sustainable way of living and working. This necessitates a shift in

Though not expressly necessary, the green transformation is often tied with the use of modern, innovative digital tools. Digitalisation, in turn, supplies tools for optimisation to underpin many efficiencies in resource use and waste reduction, target tracking and monitoring, regulatory compliance, and the generation of decision-making data for long-term planning. Many of these tasks stand to benefit from the range of applications offered by EU Space data and signals. These efficiencies will be discussed to a greater extent in the coming sections, with associated tangible use-cases and, where possible, economic impact analyses. Significant investment is needed for the green transformation,

This is made possible through a series of policies which will be introduced or updated starting from already existing measures. Many of the policies put in place in the context of the European Green Deal will deeply affect business and operations of European companies.

The European Union Space Programme in all its components has already been introduced previously in this report, together with a preliminary discussion about its role for the established Green Deal objectives. As anticipated, due to the higher impact on the topic, this report will focus primarily on the European Global Navigation Satellite Systems (EGNSS), including Galileo and EGNOS and Copernicus. As for the EGNSS, their role in support of the Green Deal’s ambitions for emissions reductions is crucial. A key example is the transport sector 13, including aviation, maritime, road, and rail transport. The sector contributes heavily to emissions in

Environmental monitoring activities are carried out on soil, atmosphere, and water by companies and institutions with the scope to assess how human activities are interfering with the biosphere. Historically, those activities always involved a first, in-situ sample collection, followed by a specific analysis process, and a final data categorisation and visualisation. All the processes mentioned above are very resource-intensive, requiring personnel on the ground to either conduct sensor maintenance or to physically collect samples. The next paragraphs show how the EU Space Programme, and in particular Copernicus, can be used by institutional and commercial players to make environmental monitoring more

A good instrument to evaluate the performance of a company in terms of environmental effort and impact is the ESG
scoring. Environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) is an approach to evaluate efforts of a company

The transition into a cleaner European industry will require concerted efforts to address product carbon footprint and durability simultaneously.

Example of real-life use case Copernicus for crop monitoring in BelgiumPotato cultivation in central Europe has enlarged to such an extent over the last decades that any further switch from any crop to potatoes is very likely to result in soil degradation and soil depletion. Thus, a higher output and growth can only be reached through an improvement in the efficiency of agricultural land utilisation. Potato fields in Belgium today achieve an output around 50 tonnes per hectare, but maximum output is expected to be double than that, around 100 tonnes/ha. This higher supply can only result from better, more
