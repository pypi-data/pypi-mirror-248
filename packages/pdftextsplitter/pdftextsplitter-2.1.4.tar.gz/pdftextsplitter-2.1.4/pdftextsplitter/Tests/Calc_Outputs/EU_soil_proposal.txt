EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM
1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL
• Reasons for and objectives of the proposal
Soil is a vital, limited, non-renewable and irreplaceable resource. Healthy soils form the
essential basis for our economy, society and environment as they produce food, increase our
resilience to climate change, to extreme weather events, drought and floods and support our
well-being. Healthy soils store carbon, have more capacity to absorb, store and filter water
and provide vital services such as safe and nutritious food and biomass for non-food
bioeconomy sectors.
Scientific evidence1 indicates that about 60 to 70% of soils in the EU are currently in an
unhealthy state. All Member States are facing the problem of soil degradation. Degradation
processes are continuing and worsening. The drivers and impacts of the problem go beyond
country borders, reducing the soil’s capacity to provide these vital services throughout the EU
and neighbouring countries. This creates risks for human health, the environment, climate,
economy and society, including risks for food security, water quality, increased impacts from
flooding and droughts, biomass production, carbon emissions and a loss of biodiversity.
The unprovoked and unjustified Russian war of aggression against Ukraine has destabilised
global food systems, intensified food security risks and vulnerabilities across the world, and
amplified the EU’s need to make its food systems sustainable for centuries to come. The
trends and combination of the different drivers impacting food security draw attention to the
fact that availability, access (affordability), utilisation, and stability cannot be taken for
granted in the short or the long term2. In this context, fertile soils are of geo-strategic
importance to secure our access to sufficient, nutritious and affordable food in the long-term.
The food supply chain is highly interconnected and dependant at global level and the EU is an
important global player on international food markets. To produce sufficient food for a global
population that is expected to grow to 9-10 billion people in 2050, fertile soils are a key asset.
Since 95% of our food is directly or indirectly produced on this precious finite natural
resource, soil degradation has a direct impact on food security and the cross-border food
markets.
Pressure on soil and land is increasing globally. In the EU, 4.2% of the territory has been
artificialized by land take; land take and soil sealing continue predominantly at the expense of
agricultural land. In addition, soil degradation affects the potential long-term fertility of
agricultural soils. It is estimated that between 61% and 73% of agricultural soils in the EU is
affected by erosion, loss of organic carbon, nutrient (nitrogen) exceedances, compaction or
secondary salinisation (or a combination of these threats). For instance, soil compaction can
lower crop yields by 2.5-15 %. Without sustainable management and action to regenerate
soils, deteriorating soil health will be a central factor in future food security crises.
Healthy soils are essential for farmers and the agronomic ecosystem overall. Maintaining or
increasing soil fertility over the long-term contributes to stable or even higher yields of crops,

feed and biomass required for non-food bioeconomy sectors contributing to the de-
fossilization of our economy3, and gives farmers long-term production security and business
prospects. The availability of healthy and fertile soils and land is crucial in the transition
towards a sustainable bioeconomy and can therefore help increase and preserve the value of
the land. Measures to increase soil fertility can also reduce farms’ operational costs, such as
the cost of inputs or machinery. Farmers can receive financial support for certain practices
e.g. under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) or the proposal for an EU carbon removal
certification framework4.
Soil degradation also harms human health. Airborne particulate matter produced by wind
erosion causes or worsens respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Sealed soils prolong the
duration of high temperatures during heat waves and have less capacity to act as a sink for
pollutants. Contaminated soils also affect food safety. For example, approximately 21% of
agricultural soils in the EU contain cadmium concentrations in the topsoil that exceed the
limit for groundwater. The recreational value of the environment and nature, with links to our
physical and mental health, is also supported by healthy and sustainably managed soils. This
is valuable both in the countryside, and especially in urban areas where the adoption of
sustainable management practices can help create healthy green spaces and reduce heat
islands, improve air quality and housing conditions. Improving soil health is key to increase
the EU’s resilience to adverse events and adaptation to climate change. Europe’s resilience to
climate change depends on the level of soil organic matter and fertility, water retention and
filtering capacity, and resistance to erosion. Carbon farming practices help store CO2 in the
soil and contribute to mitigating climate change. The capacity of soils to retain water helps
both prevent and respond to disaster risks. When soils can absorb more rainfall, it reduces the
intensity of flooding and alleviates the negative effects of drought periods. Some soil bacteria,
part of the biodiversity of healthy soils, can also help crop plants tolerate drought.
As the extreme weather and climate-related hazards intensify, the risk of wildfires is
increasing across Europe. The conditions that heighten the fire risk are set to increase with
climate change, notably heat and humidity of ecosystems, including soils. Healthy soils with
functional water retention capacity also support healthy forest ecosystems that are more
resilient to wildfires. At the same time, wildfires can cause soil degradation, leading to
increased risks of soil erosion, landslides and floods. Strengthening the knowledge base on
soils can contribute to improving disaster risk assessments that recognise the multi-faceted
roles that soils play in mitigating disasters. Measures to strengthen soil health build resilience
to future stress brought on by climate change.
Current EU and national policies have made positive contributions to improving soil health.
But they do not tackle all the drivers of soil degradation and therefore significant gaps remain.
Soils form very slowly (e.g. it takes 500 years or more to create 2,5 cm of new topsoil), but
soil health can be maintained or improved if the right measures are taken and put into
practice.
In this context, the European Green Deal5 sets out an ambitious roadmap to transform the EU
into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive

economy, aiming to protect, conserve and enhance the EU’s natural capital, and to protect the
health and well-being of citizens from environment-related risks and impacts. As part of the
European Green Deal, the Commission adopted an EU Biodiversity Strategy for 20306, a Zero
Pollution Action Plan7, an EU Climate Adaptation Strategy8 and an EU Soil Strategy for
20309.
The EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 stated that it is essential to step up efforts to protect
soil fertility, reduce soil erosion and increase soil organic matter by adopting sustainable soil
management practices. It also stated that significant progress is needed to identify
contaminated sites, restore degraded soils, define the conditions for good ecological status, set
restoration objectives, and improve the monitoring of soil health. The Biodiversity Strategy
also announced the plan to update the 2006 Soil Thematic Strategy to tackle soil degradation
and fulfil EU and international commitments on land-degradation neutrality.
The EU Soil Strategy for 2030 sets out the long-term vision to have all soils in healthy
condition by 2050, to make protection, sustainable use and restoration of soils the norm and
proposes a combination of voluntary and legislative actions to achieve these aims. The
Strategy announced that the Commission would propose a Soil Health Law underpinned by an
impact assessment which should analyse several aspects such as indicators and values for soil
health, provisions for monitoring soils and requirements for a sustainable use of soils.
The 8th Environment Action Programme10 set the priority objective that by 2050 at the latest,
people live well, within planetary boundaries in a well-being economy where nothing is
wasted, growth is regenerative, the EU has achieved climate neutrality and has significantly
reduced inequalities. Some of the enabling conditions needed to meet that objective include
tackling soil degradation and ensuring the protection and sustainable use of soil, including by
a dedicated legislative proposal on soil health.
Institutional stakeholders have called for policy changes. The European Parliament11 called on
the Commission to develop an EU legal framework for soil. It should include definitions and
criteria for good soil status and sustainable use, objectives, harmonised indicators, a
methodology for monitoring and reporting, targets, measures, and financial resources. The
Council of the EU 12 supported the Commission in stepping up efforts to better protect soils
and reaffirmed its commitment to land degradation neutrality. Furthermore, the European

Committee of the Regions 13, the European and Economic Social Committee 14 and the
European Court of Auditors 15 all called on the Commission to develop a legal framework for
the sustainable use of soil.
The importance of soil health has also been recognised at global level. The EU has made
commitments in the international context of the three Rio Conventions to address soils
affected by desertification (UN Convention to Combat Desertification), to contribute to
climate change mitigation (UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) and to constitute
an important habitat for biodiversity (Convention on Biological Diversity). Restoring,
maintaining and enhancing soil health is a target in the new Kunming-Montreal Global
Biodiversity Framework.
Soil health also directly contributes to the achievement of several UN Sustainable
Development Goals16 (SDGs), in particular SDG 15.3. This goal aims to combat
desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification,
drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world by 2030.
There is currently a lack of comprehensive and harmonized data on soil health from soil
monitoring. Some Member States have soil monitoring schemes in place, but they are
fragmented, not representative and not harmonised. Member States apply different sampling
methods, frequencies and densities, and use different metrics and analytical methods,
resulting in a lack of consistency and comparability across the EU.
For all these reasons, this proposal puts in place a solid and coherent soil monitoring
framework for all soils across the EU, which will address the current gap of knowledge on
soils. It should be an integrated monitoring system based on EU level, Member State and
private data. This data will be based on a common definition of what constitutes a healthy soil
and will underpin the sustainable management of soils, to maintain or enhance soil health, and
thus to achieve healthy and resilient soils everywhere across the EU by 2050.
The soil monitoring framework is crucial to provide the data and information needed to define
the right measures. This data is also likely to lead to technological development and
innovation and stimulate academic and industrial research, for example artificial intelligence
solutions based on data from sensing systems and field-based measuring systems. Demand for
soil analysis services will also grow, consolidating businesses and the position of specialised
SMEs in the EU. It will also support the development of remote sensing for soil and enable
the Commission to pool resources, based on current mechanisms and technology (LUCAS,
Copernicus) to offer cost-efficient services to interested Member States. This technological
progress is expected to give farmers and foresters easier access to soil data, and also lead to a
wider range, better availability and more affordable technical support for sustainable soil
management, including decision support tools.

Member States and EU bodies could use soil health data with sufficient granularity to
improve monitoring and trend analysis of drought and disaster management and resilience17.
Those data would enhance prevention and therefore contribute to a better response to
disasters. Granular soil health data would also be a useful resource for climate change
mitigation and adaptation policy implementation, also in relation to food security, and
pressures on human health and biodiversity.
The application of sustainable management practices will help Member States ensure that
soils will have the capacity to deliver the multiple ecosystems services that are vital both for
human health and the environment. These should improve the safety, health, and
infrastructure of communities and sustains the livelihood in the surrounding areas, e.g. agro-
tourism, markets, infrastructure, culture and well-being.
Current studies on specific practices at farm/land unit level conclude that the costs of
sustainable soil management are in many cases outweighed by the economic benefits, and in
all cases by the environmental benefits18. This proposal creates the requisite framework to
support soil managers until sustainable soil management and healthy soils deliver their
benefits. It can be expected that it will stimulate the earmarking of national and EU funds for
sustainable soil management, and also encourage and support private-sector funding by
financial institutions, investors and related industry, such as food processing businesses. It
would therefore consolidate the competitiveness of the activities related to soil management.
The Horizon Europe research and innovation Mission “A Soil Deal for Europe” also supports
EU ambitions for sustainable land and soil management by providing the knowledge base and
generating solutions for wider action on soil health.
The proposal also tackles soil contamination. Member States must tackle unacceptable risks
for human health and the environment caused by soil contamination to help create a toxic-free
environment by 2050. The proposed risk-based approach will allow for standards to be set at
national level so that the risk reduction measures can be adapted to site-specific conditions.
The proposal will also improve the application of the polluter-pays principle and more
societal fairness by spurring action that will benefit disadvantaged households living closer to
contaminated sites. Requirements to identify, investigate, assess and remediate contaminated
sites will generate jobs and long-term employment (e.g. increase the demand for
environmental consultants, geologists, remediation engineers, etc.).
The legislation proposes taking a gradual and proportionate approach to give Member States
sufficient time to set up their governance system, put in place the soil monitoring system,
assess soil health and start applying measures related to sustainable soil management.
• Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area
Over the past 30 years, the EU has adopted a substantial and wide range of environmental
measures with the aim of improving the quality of the environment for European citizens and
of creating the conditions for a high quality of life. Current EU law contains several

provisions of relevance to soil but there is a clear and indisputable gap in the current EU legal
framework that this proposal on soil health is designed to close. The proposal complements
existing environmental legislation by providing a coherent EU-level framework for soils. It
will also contribute to the objectives set under current environmental legislation.
Regarding soil contamination, the proposal complements the Industrial Emissions Directive,
the Waste Framework and Landfill Directives, the Environmental Liability Directive and the
Environmental Crime Directive by covering all types of contamination, including historical
soil contamination. It will make a major contribution to the protection of human health which
is one key objective pursued by EU environmental policy.
Healthy soils have an inherent capacity to absorb, store and filter water. The proposal is
therefore expected to contribute to the objectives of the Water Framework Directive, the
Groundwater Directive, the Nitrates Directive, and the Environmental Quality Standards
Directive by tackling soil contamination, soil erosion and by improving soil water retention.
Healthy soils will also contribute to flood prevention, one of the objectives of the Floods
Directive.
The provisions on sustainable soil management complement existing EU legislation relating
to nature (the Habitats and Birds Directives) by improving biodiversity (for example, wild
pollinators that nest in soils), and the air by preventing the erosion of soil particles. Healthy
soils provide the basis for life and biodiversity, including habitats, species and genes, and
contribute to reducing air pollution.
In addition, the knowledge, information and data collected under the monitoring requirements
enshrined in the proposal will help improve the assessment of environmental impacts of
projects, plans and programmes carried out under the Environmental Impact Assessment
Directive and the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive.
Lastly the proposal is consistent with several other environment policy initiatives such as:
– The EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, which sets targets to further protect nature in
the EU and in particular the proposal for a regulation on nature restoration19 (Nature
Restoration Law (NRL)). The proposed NRL has the goal of 20% of the EU’s land
and sea to be covered by restoration measures by 2030 and to cover all ecosystems in
need of restoration by restoration measures by 2050. There are many synergies
among the proposed NRL and this proposal on soil health. The proposed NRL and
this proposal are therefore mutually reinforcing.
– The Zero Pollution Action Plan sets out the vision that by 2050, air, water and soil
pollution is reduced to levels no longer considered harmful to health and natural
ecosystems. This proposal is consistent with the proposals aiming to revise and
strengthen key existing EU legislation in the air and water sectors and the legislation
on industrial activities.
– The Circular Economy Action Plan, which announces measures to reduce micro-
plastics and an evaluation of the Sewage Sludge Directive, regulating the quality of
sludge used in agriculture.

– The Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability, which recognises that chemicals are
essential for the well-being of modern society but aims to better protect citizens and
the environment against their possible hazardous properties.
• Consistency with other Union policies
The proposal is consistent with EU policies on climate, food and agriculture.
The initiative is a crucial centrepiece of the European Green Deal and an instrument to
achieve EU policy objectives such as climate neutrality, resilient nature and biodiversity, zero
pollution, sustainable food systems, human health and well-being.
The objectives of the proposal are complementary and in synergy with the European Climate
Law20. They will contribute to the EU climate change adaptation objectives by making the EU
more resilient and to its aim to achieve a climate-neutral Europe by 2050. Storing carbon in
soil is an essential part of the action needed to reach climate neutrality. Achieving this
objective requires action in multiple areas, such as carbon removals through sustainable soil
management to balance greenhouse gas emissions that will remain at the end of an ambitious
decarbonisation pathway. This proposal will also contribute to the EU’s climate change
adaptation objectives, make the EU more resilient and reduce its vulnerability to climate
change, for example by enhancing the capacity of soils to retain water.
The proposal is fully complementary and synergetic with the Land Use, Land Use Change and
Forestry (LULUCF) Regulation21, as revised recently to make it fit to the target to reduce net
emissions by 55% by 2030. The revised LULUCF Regulation22 aims to achieve 310 Mt CO2
equivalent net removals in the LULUCF sector by 2030 at EU level. For the period 2026-
2029, each Member State will have a binding national goal to progressively increase of
greenhouse gas removals. These objectives require all Member States to step up the level of
climate ambition for their land use policies. The LULUCF Regulation moreover requires that
Member States set up systems to monitor soil carbon stocks, with the expectation of enhanced
implementation of nature-based climate mitigation in soils. This proposal on soil health and
the revised LULUCF Regulation will be mutually reinforcing, since healthy soils sequester
more carbon and the LULUCF targets promote the sustainable management of soils.
Enhanced and more representative soil monitoring will also improve the monitoring of
successful policy implementation in the LULUCF sector.
The aim of the proposed regulation for a certification framework for carbon removal23 is to
facilitate the deployment of high-quality carbon removals through a voluntary EU
certification framework with high climate and environmental integrity. Carbon removals also
constitute a new business model in the voluntary carbon market. This initiative is instrumental

in ensuring the soil’s capacity to absorb and store carbon. Conversely, regenerating soil to
good health is instrumental in increasing its capacity to absorb and store carbon and to
generate carbon removal credits. Moreover, creating soil districts, as envisaged under the
initiative on soil, and generating the related data and knowledge will facilitate implementation
of the carbon removal certification.
Lastly, a commensurate certification of healthy soil is expected to increase the value of the
carbon removal certificate and give greater social and market recognition for sustainable soil
management and related food and non-food products. The benefits of healthy soils and
measures to achieve this will also help boost private financing, as food industry and other
business have already started putting in place programmes to pay for ecosystem services and
support sustainable practices related to soil health. At the same time, soil certified as healthy
is likely to increase the value of the land, e.g. for the purposes of collateral, sale or succession.
This proposal is consistent with the Farm to Fork Strategy24 which aims to reduce nutrient
losses by at least 50% while ensuring that there is no deterioration in soil fertility. In addition,
the proposal on soil health will contribute to making the EU food system more resilient.
The proposal supports the efforts made by the agricultural sector under the CAP25 with its
new rules to increase the environmental performance of the agricultural sector, also
manifested in the CAP strategic plans 2023-202726. This policy includes some mandatory
environmental and climate conditions (good agricultural and environmental conditions) that
farmers must meet in order to receive CAP income support. Some of these conditions are
linked to soil management practices (such as practices to limit soil erosion (e.g. tillage
management), minimum soil cover and crop rotation) and are expected to help maintain or
enhance soil health on agricultural soils. The CAP also provides for financial support to
farmers who commit to undertake specific environmental and climate practices or investments
going beyond these conditions. According to the approved CAP Strategic Plans for the period
2023-2027, by 2027, half of the EU’s used agricultural area will be supported by
commitments beneficial for soil management to improve soil quality and biota (such as
reducing tillage, soil cover in sensitive periods with intermediary crops, crop rotation
including leguminous crops). By strengthening the CAP’s innovation dimension, Member
States have planned to set up more than 6.600 Operational Groups out of which about 1.000
are expected to address soil health issues. Due to these links, this directive should be taken
into account when, in accordance with Article 159 of Regulation (EU) 2021/2115, the
Commission reviews, by 31 December 2025, the list set out in Annex XIII to that Regulation.
This proposal on soil will lay down sustainable management principles applicable to managed
soils in Europe, including agricultural soils. It will give Member States flexibility to apply
these principles as they see best, and to choose how to integrate these in their CAP strategic
plans. This proposal will also provide the tools to improve the monitoring of the impacts of
the support instruments under the CAP.

This proposal is consistent with the proposal to transform the current Farm Accountancy Data
Network (FADN) into a Farm Sustainability Data Network (FSDN)27, included in the Farm to
Fork Strategy. The new FSDN will aim to collect farm level data on sustainability and
contribute to the improvement of advisory services to farmers and benchmarking of farm
performance. Once transformed, the new network will allow the European Commission and
Member States to monitor the development of specific agro-environmental practices at farm
level, including soil management practices.
This proposal is consistent with other EU policy objectives aimed at achieving the EU’s open
strategic autonomy, such as the ones under the proposal for a European Critical Raw
Materials Act28 that aim at ensuring secure and sustainable supply of critical raw materials for
Europe’s industry, and should be implemented accordingly.
2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY
• Legal basis
The provisions of this proposal relate to environmental protection. The legal basis for this
proposal is therefore Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union
that sets out how Article 191 of the Treaty should be implemented. Article 191 of the Treaty
specifies the objectives of EU environmental policy:
– preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment;
– protecting human health;
– utilising natural resources prudently and rationally;
– promoting measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide
environmental problems, in particular to combat climate change.
The proposal does not contain measures affecting land use.
Given that this is an area of shared competence between the EU and the Member States, EU
action must comply with the subsidiarity principle.
• Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)
Action at EU level is justified given the scale and cross-border nature of the problem, the
impact of soil degradation across the EU and the risks to the environment, economy and
society.
Soil degradation is often wrongly considered as a purely local issue and the transboundary
impacts are underestimated. The drivers and impacts of the problem go beyond country
borders and reduce the provision of ecosystem services in multiple countries as soil is washed
away by water or blown by winds. Contaminants can become mobile via the air, surface water
and groundwater, they can move across borders and can affect food.

In ways that are rarely seen or acknowledged, healthy soils are essential to tackle global
societal challenges. Soils play a key role in the nutrient, carbon and water cycles, and these
processes are clearly not constrained by physical and political borders.
Therefore, coordinated measures by all Member States are needed to achieve the vision to
have all soils healthy by 2050, as set out in the Soil Strategy for 2030, and to ensure that soil
has the capacity to provide ecosystem services across the EU in the long-term.
Unless we rapidly halt the current level of soil degradation and regenerate soil to good health,
our food system will become less productive and increasingly vulnerable to climate change
and reliant on resource-intensive inputs. Individual action by the Member States has proven to
be insufficient to remedy the situation, since soil degradation is continuing and even
worsening.
Given that some aspects of soil health are only marginally covered by EU legislation,
additional EU action is needed to complement current requirements and to fill the policy gaps.
The proposal is designed to create the conditions for action to manage soils sustainably and to
tackle the costs of soil degradation. The objectives of the proposed action can be better
achieved at EU level because of the scale and effects it will produce. Coordinated action is
needed at sufficiently large scale to monitor and to sustainably manage soils in order to
benefit from synergies, effectiveness and efficiency gains. Coordinated action is also needed
to meet the commitments on soil health made at both EU and global level. There is a risk that
if soil is not properly protected, the EU and its Member States will fail to meet international
and European Green Deal commitments on the environment, sustainable development and
climate. Lastly, action at EU level is essential to address potential distortions on the internal
market and unfair competition among businesses since there are lower environmental
requirements in some Member States.
• Proportionality
The proposal complies with the proportionality principle because it does not go beyond what
is necessary to have all soils in the EU healthy by 2050. The proposed instrument is a
directive that leaves much flexibility to the Member States to identify the best measures for
them and to adapt the approach to local conditions. This is crucial to take account of the
regional and local specificities as regards soil variability, land use, climatological conditions
and socio-economic aspects.
The proposal ensures that its objectives are reached with requirements that are both realistic
and do not go beyond what is necessary. For this reason, Member States are given sufficient
time to gradually put in place the governance, the mechanisms to monitor and assess soil
health and the measures needed to implement the sustainable soil management principles.
To ensure the EU reaches its objectives, the proposal lays down obligations to monitor and
assess soil health and to review the effectiveness of the measures taken. The impact
assessment evaluated the impacts of all policy options and showed that the proposals are
proportionate.
• Choice of the instrument
A legislative rather than a non-legislative approach is needed to meet the long-term objective
of healthy soil in the EU by 2050. The proposal provides a coherent framework for soil
monitoring and sustainable management in this respect. The proposal leaves much flexibility
EN
10
EN
to the Member States to identify the best measures for them and to adapt the approach to local
conditions. These objectives can be best pursued in the form of a directive. The wide range of
soil conditions and uses across the EU, and the need for flexibility and subsidiarity, mean that
a directive is the best legal instrument to meet this purpose.
A directive requires Member States to achieve its objectives and implement the measures into
their national substantive and procedural law systems. But directives give Member States
more freedom when implementing an EU measure than regulations, in that Member States
can choose how to implement the measures set out in the directive.
3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER
CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS
• Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation
Not applicable since there is currently no EU-wide legislation specifically on soil.
The evaluation of the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 (SWD(2022)284) confirmed that soil
degradation and loss and desertification pose a threat to habitats and species. It also stated that
nature-based solutions are essential to help reduce emissions and adapt to a changing climate.
• Stakeholder consultations
The Commission organised a call for evidence on soil health between 16 February 2022 and
16 March 2022 that received 189 replies.
Between 1 August 2022 and 24 October 2022, the Commission organised an online public
consultation on the potential Soil Health Law on protecting, sustainably managing and
restoring soils. It received 5 782 responses.
Since 2015, the Commission has maintained an open dialogue with Member States via the EU
expert group on soil protection. The group typically met twice a year but convened eight
times in 2022 to discuss several aspects of the Soil Health Law based on thematic working
papers prepared by the Commission. In October 2022, the expert group was extended to
include stakeholder groups other than Member States. The expert group met twice in the new
composition on 4 October 2022 and 7 February 2023 and discussed the Soil Law in these
meetings.
The Commission also organised interviews and sent targeted questionnaires to elicit the views
of experts on the costs, feasibility and impacts of certain measures. It collected responses
between 14 and 28 November 2022.
A synopsis report of all consultation activities is annexed to the impact assessment (Annex 2).
It describes the strategy, method and overview of the feedback received. The Commission
took full account of the views of the stakeholders when comparing the various policy options
(see Annex 10 to the impact assessment).
• Collection and use of expertise
The Commission drew substantially from the expertise of the EU expert group on soil
protection which discussed several thematic papers prepared by the Commission and on the
internal research expertise developed by the Joint Research Centre.
EN
11
EN
The Commission also drew on the publicly available data and knowledge from competent
organisations such as the FAO, EEA, IPBES and European Academies Science Advisory
Council. It collected further expertise through service contracts and EU-funded projects
notably under Horizon programmes.
• Impact assessment
The proposal is based on an impact assessment. After having resolved the issues raised in the
Regulatory Scrutiny Board’s negative opinion issued on 17 February 2023, the draft impact
assessment received a positive opinion with reservations on 28 April 2023. The Regulatory
Scrutiny Board required in particular to clarify the content and feasibility of the options, to
reflect the risks of not reaching the objective of healthy soils across EU by 2050, to nuance
the analysis of the impacts on competitiveness and to be more explicit on the views of
Member States.
In the impact assessment, the policy options have been described by using five key building
blocks:
(1) definition of soil health and establishment of soil districts,
(2) monitoring of soil health,
(3) sustainable soil management,
(4) identification, registration, investigation and assessment of contaminated sites,
(5) restoration (regeneration) of soil health and remediation of contaminated sites.
Options have been designed for each of the five building blocks, by modulating flexibility and
harmonisation to different degrees corresponding to meaningful potential solutions. One
option was designed to give the highest degree of flexibility for Member States, another with
the highest degree of harmonisation and a third gives an intermediate degree of harmonisation
and flexibility. Option 1 is a monitoring-only scenario without measures on sustainable soil
management, regeneration and remediation, but it was discarded at an early stage because it
was deemed insufficient to achieve the objectives and meet stakeholders’ expectations.
The preferred option combined the most effective, efficient and policy coherent options
selected from each building block. For all building blocks, except for the remediation of
contaminated sites, Option 3 providing an intermediate level of flexibility and harmonisation
was chosen (and very flexible Option 2 for remediation). The preferred option resulting from
the impact assessment was based on a staged approach that would give Member States time to
put in place the mechanisms to first assess the condition of soils and then decide on the
regeneration measures needed once the conclusions are available.
The preferred option was designed to tackle the costs of soil degradation, in particular the
resulting loss of ecosystem services. It would ensure that the EU will achieve its policy
objectives, such as healthy soils and the zero-pollution ambition by 2050, in a cost-efficient
manner. Most benefits come from avoiding costs by tackling soil degradation. The highest
costs relate to the implementation of measures for sustainable soil management and
regeneration. The benefits of the initiative were estimated at around EUR 74 billion per year.
Total costs would be of the order of EUR 28-38 billion per year. For contaminated sites, the
annual cost is highly uncertain. It is estimated at EUR 1.9 billion for the identify and
investigate contaminated sites and EUR 1 billion a year to remediate contaminated sites.
EN
12
EN
Although it was not possible to quantify and monetise all impacts, the benefit-cost ratio of the
preferred option was estimated at a conservative and prudent 1.7. It also requires Member
States to ensure public participation, in particular from soil managers, farmers and foresters.
The transition to sustainable soil management requires investments to reap the long-term
benefits of healthy soils for the environment, economy and society. Successful
implementation of the preferred option requires tapping various sources of funding at
European, national, regional and local level. Therefore, this proposal is published alongside a
Staff Working Document (SWD) providing an overview of funding opportunities available
under the EU’s 2021-2027 multiannual budget for the protection, sustainable management,
and regeneration of soils. Member States also continue sharing knowledge, experience and
expertise in several interconnected EU platforms on soil health.
The proposal corresponds to the preferred option for all building blocks except for the
building block on soil restoration. The proposal is less demanding in terms of soil
regeneration than the preferred option contained in the impact assessment in order to limit the
burden on Member States, landowners and land managers. In particular, the proposal does not
require Member States to create any new programmes of measures or soil health plans.
However, since this approach may entail an increased risk not to reach the objective of
healthy soils by 2050, it is proposed that the Commission will carry out an analysis on the
need to set more specific requirements to restore/regenerate unhealthy soils by 2050 in the
context of an early evaluation of the directive scheduled 6 years after its entry into force. This
analysis will be based on exchanges with the Member States and interested parties, and will
take into account the conclusions of the assessment of soil health, the progress on sustainable
soil management and the advancement of knowledge on the criteria for the descriptors of soil
health.
• Regulatory fitness and simplification
The business sectors expected to be affected by the initiative include agriculture, forestry and
related extension services, business activities that have contaminated the soil, business
activities related to remediation of contaminated sites, research and laboratories. Soil
degradation affects their productivity and competitiveness. Action taken to address
degradation is not rewarded, and affects the level playing field.
Implementing the proposal will create several opportunities for growth and innovation,
including for EU SMEs, both in designing and applying sustainable soil management
practices, and in investigating and remediating contaminated soils. In addition, setting up a
soil monitoring system is expected to create opportunities for research and development and
business to develop new technologies and innovations for monitoring and assessing soil
health.
To further reduce the administrative burden, the proposal does not require Member States to
create any new programmes of measures for sustainable soil management or regeneration. In
addition, it draws as much as possible on digital and remote sensing solutions. The Member
States will report to the Commission only every 5 years and reporting is limited to the
information that the Commission needs to fulfil its role in overseeing implementation of the
directive, evaluate it and report to the other EU institutions.
EN
13
EN
• Fundamental rights
The proposed directive respects fundamental rights and the principles enshrined in the EU
Charter of Fundamental Rights. The proposal lays down measures to achieve healthy soils by
2050 and to ensure that soil contamination is reduced to levels no longer considered harmful
to human health and the environment. This will provide protection to socially and
economically disadvantaged communities living on or close to contaminated sites. The
proposal seeks to integrate into EU policies a high level of environmental protection and to
improve the quality of the environment, in line with the principle of sustainable development
laid down in Article 37 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. It also puts into concrete
terms the obligation to protect the right to life as laid down in Article 2 of the Charter.
The proposal contributes to the right to an effective remedy before a tribunal, as laid down in
Article 47 of the Charter, with detailed provisions on access to justice and penalties.
The proposal does not regulate the use of property and respects the right of property laid
down in Article 17 of the Charter. However, to fulfil the obligations related to monitoring soil
health (to take soil samples), the competent authorities in the Member States may need to
require landowners to give them the right to access their property in line with the applicable
national rules and procedures. Member States may also require that landowners implement
measures to manage the soil in a sustainable manner.
4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS
The proposal will have budgetary implications for the Commission in terms of the human and
administrative resources required.
The Commission’s implementation and enforcement workload will increase because of this
new initiative, which sets a new framework for soil monitoring and assessment, sustainable
management and regeneration. The Commission will need to manage a new committee and
verify the completeness and compliance of transposition measures. It will also need to
monitor and analyse data reported by Member States, adopt implementing acts and provide
guidance where needed.
The Commission will step up action on soil monitoring implementation and integration. It
will seek support from the scientific community with support from the Joint Research Centre
and by launching EU-funded projects.
The European Environment Agency will create a new infrastructure for reporting analyses,
support for policies on soil protection and the work needed to integrate soil data with other
policy areas. Synergies will be sought with other tasks. A potential need for minor
reinforcement will be grouped together in a Legislative Financial Statement of a forthcoming
legal proposal.
The annexed financial statement shows the budgetary implications and the human and
administrative resources required.

EN
5. OTHER ELEMENTS
• Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements
After the proposed directive enters into force, Member States will have a maximum of 2 years
to adopt measures needed to transpose the directive and to notify these measures to the
Commission.
The Commission will verify the completeness of the transposition measures notified by the
Member States and the compliance of these measures based on explanatory documents
explaining the relationship between the components of the directive and the corresponding
parts of national transposition instruments.
The proposal has several provisions governing the monitoring arrangements. It puts in place a
coherent soil monitoring framework to provide data on soil health in all Member States and
for all soils. These data will be made public in accordance with the applicable legislation.
The register of contaminated and potentially contaminated sites will enable the Commission
and citizens, NGOs and other interested parties to monitor the obligations regarding soil
contamination.
The proposal also sets out reporting provisions. Member States are required to report to the
Commission on a limited number of issues every 5 years.
The proposal provides for an evaluation of the directive which will be based on the
information reported by Member States and any other available information. This evaluation
will serve as a basis for revising the directive. The main findings of the evaluation will be
transmitted to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social
Committee, and the Committee of the Regions.
The proposal also contains provisions to adapt the rules in line with scientific and technical
progress.
• Explanatory documents (for directives)
The proposed directive touches on environmental law and aims to regulate soil health at EU
level while giving Member States a wide degree of flexibility on how to achieve the
objectives. There is currently no dedicated EU legislation on soil and the proposed directive
contains new concepts and obligations regarding soils which will mainly affect public
authorities and stakeholders in agriculture, forestry and industrial sectors.
Member States might use different legal instruments to transpose the directive and might need
to amend existing national provisions. It is likely that implementing the directive will affect
not only the central/national level of legislation in the Member States but also different levels
of regional and local legislation. Explanatory documents will therefore aid the process to
verify transposition and help reducing the administrative burden on the Commission of
compliance monitoring. Without these, considerable resources and numerous contacts with
national authorities would be required to track the methods of transposition in all Member
States.
Against this background it is proportionate to ask Member States to shoulder the burden of
providing explanatory documents in order to equip the Commission for overseeing
transposition of the proposed directive, which is central to the European Green Deal. Member
EN
15
EN
States should therefore notify transposition measures along with one or more documents
explaining how the components of the directive are linked with the corresponding parts of
national transposition instruments. This is in accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of
28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents.
• Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal
Article 1 sets out the overarching objective of the directive which is to put in place a coherent
soil monitoring framework that will provide data on soil health in all Member States and to
ensure that EU soils are in healthy condition by 2050 at the latest, so that they can supply
multiple services at a scale sufficient to meet environmental, societal and economic needs and
to reduce soil pollution to levels no longer considered harmful to human health. The directive
contributes to preventing and mitigating the impacts of climate change, increasing resilience
against natural disasters and ensuring food security.
Article 2 sets out the territorial scope of the directive which applies to all soil in the EU.
Article 3 provides definitions.
Articles 4 and 5 set out the governance requirements. Article 4 states that Member States must
establish soil districts throughout their territory to manage the soils and the requirements of
the directive. Article 4 also lays down criteria for Member States to use when establishing
such soil districts. Article 5 requires Member States to appoint the authorities tasked with
carrying out the obligations set out in the directive.
Article 6 describes the overall monitoring framework based on the soil districts, to ensure that
soil health is monitored regularly. It also describes how the Commission can support the
action taken by the Member States on soil health monitoring.
Article 7 lays down the soil descriptors and criteria for monitoring and assessing soil health. It
specifies that some criteria will be established by the Member States.
Article 8 states that Member States must carry out regular soil measurements. It further lays
down methodologies for identifying the sampling points and for measuring the soil
descriptors.
Article 9 requires Member States to assess soil health based on regular soil measurements in
order to ascertain whether the soils are healthy.
Article 10 lays down sustainable soil management principles that aim to maintain or enhance
soil health.
Article 11 provides for mitigation principles that the Member States must follow in the event
of land take.
Article 12 sets an overarching obligation to take a risk-based approach to identifying and
investigating potentially contaminated sites and for managing contaminated sites.
Article 13 requires that all potentially contaminated sites are identified and Article 14 requires
that these sites are investigated to ascertain the presence of contamination.
Article 15 contains obligations regarding the management of contaminated sites. It sets out
that Member States must carry out a site-specific risk assessment to ascertain whether the
EN
16
EN
contaminated site poses unacceptable risks to human health or the environment and to take the
appropriate risk reduction measures.
Article 16 requires Member States to draw up a register of contaminated sites and potentially
contaminated sites. It states that the register must contain the information set out in Annex VII
and that it must be publicly accessible and kept up to date.
Article 17 contains provisions regarding EU financing.
Articles 18 contains reporting requirements. It states that Member States must regularly report
data and information to the Commission in electronic format.
Article 19 provides for access to information to increase transparency.
Articles 20 sets out the conditions for the Commission to adopt delegated acts.
Article 21 sets out the conditions for the Commission to adopt implementing acts (Committee
procedure).
Article 22 contains requirements governing access to justice.
Article 23 requires Member States to lay down the rules on penalties applicable to breaches of
the national provisions adopted under the directive. The penalties must be effective,
proportionate and dissuasive.
Article 24 provides for an evaluation of the directive.
Article 25 contains requirements to transpose the directive into national law.
Article 26 provides for the entry into force of the directive.
Article 27 specifies that the directive is addressed to the Member States.

Proposal for a
DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
on Soil Monitoring and Resilience (Soil Monitoring Law)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular
Article 192(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee29,
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions30,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,
Whereas:
(1) Soil is a vital, limited, non-renewable and irreplaceable resource that is crucial for the
economy, the environment and the society.
(2) Healthy soils are in good chemical, biological and physical condition so that they can
provide ecosystem services that are vital to humans and the environment, such as safe,
nutritious and sufficient food, biomass, clean water, nutrients cycling, carbon storage
and a habitat for biodiversity. However, 60 to 70 % of the soils in the Union are
deteriorated and continue to deteriorate.
(3) Soil degradation is costing the Union several tens of billion euro every year. Soil
health is impacting the provision of ecosystem services that have an important
economic return. Sustainable management and regeneration of soils therefore makes
sound economic sense and can significantly increase the price and value of the land in
the Union.
(4) The European Green Deal31 has set out an ambitious roadmap to transform the Union
into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive
economy, aiming to protect, conserve and enhance the Union’s natural capital, and to
protect the health and well-being of citizens. As part of the European Green Deal, the
Commission has adopted the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 203032, the Farm to Fork

(5) The Union is committed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)37. Healthy soils contribute directly to the
achievement of several SDGs, in particular SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health
and well-being), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and
communities), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), SDG 13 (climate
action) and SDG 15 (life on land). SDG 15.3 aims to combat desertification, restore
degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods,
and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world by 2030.
(6) The Union and its Member States, as parties to the Convention on Biological
Diversity, approved by Council Decision 93/626/EEC38, agreed at the 15th Conference
of the Parties on the “Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework” (GBF)39
which comprises several action-oriented global targets for 2030 of relevance for soil
health. Nature’s contributions to people, including soil health, should be restored,
maintained and enhanced.
(7) The Union and its Member States, as Parties to the UN Convention to Combat
Desertification (UNCCD), approved by Council Decision 98/216/EC40, have
committed to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of drought in affected
countries. Thirteen Member States41 have declared themselves as parties affected by
desertification under the UNCDD.
(8) In the context of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) land and soil is considered simultaneously as a source and a sink of
carbon. The Union and Member States as parties have committed to promote
sustainable management, conservation and enhancement of carbon sinks and
reservoirs.

sustainable soil management practices. It also states that significant progress is needed
on identifying contaminated soil sites, restoring degraded soils, defining the conditions
for good ecological status of soils, introducing restoration objectives, and improving
the monitoring of soil health.
(10) The EU Soil Strategy for 2030 sets the long-term vision that by 2050, all EU soil
ecosystems are in healthy condition and are thus more resilient. As a key solution,
healthy soils contribute to address the EU’s goals of achieving climate neutrality and
becoming resilient to climate change, developing a clean and circular (bio)economy,
reversing biodiversity loss, safeguarding human health, halting desertification and
reversing land degradation.
(11) Funding is vital to enable a transition to healthy soils. The Multiannual Financial
Framework presents several funding opportunities available for the protection,
sustainable management and regeneration of soils. A ‘Soil Deal for Europe’ is one of
the five EU missions of the Horizon Europe programme and is specifically dedicated
to promoting soil health. The Soil Mission is a key instrument for the implementation
of this Directive. It aims to lead the transition to healthy soils through funding an
ambitious research and innovation programme, establishing a network of 100 living
labs and lighthouses in rural and urban areas, advancing the development of a
harmonized soil monitoring framework and increasing the awareness of the
importance of soil. Other Union programmes that present objectives contributing to
healthy soils are the Common Agricultural Policy, the Cohesion Policy funds, the
Programme for Environment and Climate Action, the Horizon Europe work
programme, the Technical Support Instrument, the Recovery and Resilience Facility
and InvestEU.
(12) The Soil Strategy for 2030 announced that the Commission would table a legislative
proposal on soil health to enable the objectives of the Soil Strategy and to achieve
good soil health across the EU by 2050. In its resolution of 28 April 2021 on soil
protection42, the European Parliament emphasised the importance of protecting soil
and promoting healthy soils in the Union, bearing in mind that the degradation
continues, despite the limited and uneven action being taken in some Member States.
The European Parliament called on the Commission to design a Union wide common
legal framework, with full respect for the subsidiarity principle, for the protection and
sustainable use of soil, addressing all major soil threats.
(13) In its conclusions of 23 October 202043, the Council supported the Commission in
stepping up efforts to better protect soils and soil biodiversity, as a non-renewable
resource of vital importance.
(14) Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council44 sets out a
binding objective of climate neutrality in the Union by 2050 and negative emissions
thereafter, and of prioritising swift and predictable emission reductions and, at the
same time, enhancing removals by natural sinks. Sustainable soil management results
in increased carbon sequestration and in most cases in co-benefits for ecosystems and

biodiversity. The Commission’s Communication on Sustainable Carbon Cycles45
underlined the need for clear and transparent identification of the activities that
unambiguously remove carbon from the atmosphere such as the development of a EU
framework for the certification of carbon removals from natural ecosystems including
soils. Moreover, the revised Regulation on Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry
not only places soil carbon central to the achievement of targets on the pathway to a
climate neutral Europe, but also calls for Member States to prepare a system for the
monitoring of soil carbon stocks, using, inter alia, the land use/cover area frame
statistical survey (LUCAS) dataset.
(15) The Commission’s Communication on adaptation to climate change46 underlined that
using nature-based solutions inland, including the restoration of the sponge-like
function of soils, will boost the supply of clean and fresh water, reduce the impacts of
flooding and alleviate the impacts of droughts. It is important to maximise the capacity
of soils to retain and purify water and reduce pollution.
(16) The Zero Pollution Action Plan adopted by the Commission sets out the vision for
2050 that air, water and soil pollution is reduced to levels no longer considered
harmful to health and natural ecosystems and that respect the boundaries our planet
can cope with, thus creating a toxic-free environment.
(17) The Commission’s Communication on safeguarding food security and reinforcing the
resilience of food systems47 stressed that food sustainability is fundamental for food
security. Healthy soils make the Union food system more resilient by providing the
basis for nutritious and sufficient food.
(18) It is necessary to set measures for monitoring and assessing soil health, managing soils
sustainably and tackling contaminated sites to achieve healthy soils by 2050, to
maintain them in healthy condition and meet the Union’s objectives on climate and
biodiversity, to prevent and respond to droughts and natural disasters, to protect
human health and to ensure food security and safety.
(19) Soils host more than 25% of all biodiversity and are the second largest carbon pool of
the planet. Due to their ability to capture and store carbon, healthy soils contribute to
the achievement of the Union’s objectives on climate change. Healthy soils also
provide a favourable habitat for organisms to thrive and are crucial for enhancing
biodiversity and the stability of ecosystems. Biodiversity below and above ground are
intimately connected and interact through mutualistic relationships (e.g. mycorrhizal
fungi that connect plant roots).
(20) Floods, wildfires and extreme weather events are natural disaster risks of the highest
concern across Europe. The concern for droughts and water scarcity is rapidly
increasing across the Union. In 2020, 24 Member States considered droughts and
water scarcity to be key emerging or climate related disaster risks, compared to only
11 Member States in 2015. Healthy soils are instrumental for the resilience to droughts

and natural disasters. Practices that enhance water retention and nutrient availability in
soils, soil structure, soil biodiversity and carbon sequestration, increase the resilience
of ecosystems, plants and crops to withstand and recover from drought, natural
disasters, heatwaves and extreme weather events which will become more frequent in
the future due to climate change. In turn, without proper soil management, drought and
natural disasters cause soil degradation and make soils unhealthy. Improvement of soil
health helps to mitigate the economic losses and fatalities associated with climate-
related extremes, which amounted to approximately 560 billion EUR and more than
182.000 casualties in the Union between 1980 and 2021.
(21) Soil health contributes directly to human health and well-being. Healthy soils provide
safe and nutritious food, and have the ability to filter contaminants, hence preserving
drinking water quality. Soil contamination can harm human health through ingestion,
inhalation or dermal contact. Human exposure to the healthy soil microbial community
is beneficial to develop the immune system and resistance against certain diseases and
allergies. Healthy soils support the growth of trees, flowers, and grasses, and create
green infrastructure that offers aesthetic value, well-being, and quality of life.
(22) Soil degradation impacts fertility, yields, pest resistance and nutritional food quality.
Since 95 % of our food is directly or indirectly produced on soils and the global
population continues to increase, it is key that this finite natural resource remains
healthy to ensure food security in the long-term and secure the productivity and
profitability of Union agriculture. Sustainable soil management practices maintain or
enhance soil health and contribute to the sustainability and resilience of the food
system.
(23) The long-term objective of the Directive is to achieve healthy soils by 2050. As an
intermediate step, in light of the limited knowledge about the condition of soils and
about the effectiveness and costs of the measures to regenerate their health, the
directive takes a staged approach. In the first stage the focus will be on setting up the
soil monitoring framework and assessing the situation of soils throughout the EU. It
also includes requirements to lay down measures to manage soils sustainably and
regenerate unhealthy soils once their condition is established, but without imposing an
obligation to achieve healthy soils by 2050 neither intermediate targets. This
proportionate approach will allow sustainable soil management and regeneration of
unhealthy soils to be well prepared, incentivised and set in motion. In a second stage,
as soon as the results of the first assessment of soils and trends analysis are available,
the Commission will take stock of the progress towards the 2050 objective and the
experience thereof, and will propose a review of the directive if necessary to accelerate
progress towards 2050.
(24) Addressing the pressures on soils and identifying the appropriate measures to maintain
or regenerate soil health requires that the variety of soil types, the specific local and
climatic conditions and the land use or the land cover is taken into account. It is
therefore appropriate that Member States establish soil districts. Soil districts should
constitute the basic governance units to manage soils and to take measures to comply
with the requirements laid down in this Directive, in particular with regard to the
monitoring and assessment of soil health. The number, geographic extent and
boundaries of soil districts for each Member State should be determined in order to
facilitate the implementation of Regulation (UE) …/…. of the European Parliament
EN
22
EN
and of the Council+. There should be a minimum number of soil districts in each
Member State taking into account the size of the Member State. This minimum
number of soil districts for each Member State shall correspond to the number of
NUTS 1 territorial units established in Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European
Parliament and of the Council48.
(25) In order to ensure an appropriate governance on soils, Member States should be
required to appoint a competent authority for each soil district. Member States should
be allowed to appoint any additional competent authority at appropriate level
including at national or regional level.
(26) In order to have a common definition of healthy soil condition, there is a need to
define a minimum common set of measurable criteria, which, if not respected leads to
a critical loss in the soil’s capacity to function as a vital living system and to provide
ecosystem services. Such criteria should reflect and be based on the existing level of
soil science.
(27) In order to describe soil degradation it is necessary to establish soil descriptors that can
be measured or estimated. Even if there is significant variability between soil types,
climatic conditions and land uses, the current scientific knowledge allows to set
criteria at Union level for some of those soil descriptors. However, Member States
should be able to adapt the criteria for some of these soil descriptors based on specific
national or local conditions and define the criteria for other soil descriptors for which
common criteria at EU level cannot be established at this stage. For those descriptors
for which clear criteria that would distinguish between healthy and unhealthy
condition cannot be identified now, only monitoring and assessment are required. This
will facilitate the development of such criteria in future.
(28) In order to create incentives, Member States should set up mechanisms to recognize
the efforts of landowners and land managers to maintain the soil in healthy condition,
including in the form of soil health certification complementary to the Union
regulatory framework for carbon removals, and supporting the implementation of the
renewable energy sustainability criteria set out in article 29 of Directive (EU)
2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council49. The Commission should
facilitate soil health certification by inter alia exchanging information and promoting
best practices, raising awareness and assessing feasibility of developing recognition of
certification schemes at Union level. Synergies between different certification schemes
should be exploited as much as possible to reduce administrative burden for those
applying for relevant certifications.
(29) Some soils have special characteristics either because they are atypical by nature and
constitute rare habitats for biodiversity or unique landscapes or because they have
been heavily modified by humans. Those characteristics should be taken into account
in the context of the definition of healthy soils and the requirements to achieve healthy
soil condition.

(30) Soil is a limited resource subject to an ever-growing competition for different uses.
Land take is a process often driven by economic development needs, that transforms
natural and semi-natural areas (including agricultural and forestry land, gardens and
parks) into artificial land development, using soil as a platform for constructions and
infrastructure, as a direct source of raw material or as archive for historic patrimony.
This transformation may cause the loss, often irreversibly, of the capacity of soils to
provide other ecosystem services (provision of food and biomass, water and nutrients
cycling, basis for biodiversity and carbon storage). In particular, land take often affects
the most fertile agricultural soils, putting food security in jeopardy. Sealed soil also
exposes human settlements to higher flood peaks and more intense heat island effects.
Therefore, it is necessary to monitor land take and soil sealing and their effects on
soil’s capacity to provide ecosystem services. It is also appropriate to lay down certain
principles to mitigate the impacts of land take as part of sustainable soil management.
(31) The assessment of soil health based on the monitoring network should be accurate
while at the same time keeping the costs of such monitoring at reasonable level. It is
therefore appropriate to lay down criteria for sampling points that are representative of
the soil condition under different soil types, climatic conditions and land use. The grid
of sampling points should be determined by using geostatistical methods and be
sufficiently dense to provide an estimation of the area of healthy soils, at national
level, within an uncertainty of not more than 5%. This value is commonly considered
to provide a statistically sound estimation and reasonable assurance that the objective
has been achieved.
(32) The Commission should assist and support Member States’ monitoring of soil health
by continuing to carry out and enhancing regular in-situ soil sampling and related soil
measurements (LUCAS soil) as part of the Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical
Survey (LUCAS) Programme. For that purpose, the LUCAS Programme shall be
enhanced and upgraded to fully align it with the specific quality requirements to be
met for the purpose of this Directive. In order to alleviate the burden, Member States
should be allowed to take into account the soil health data surveyed under the
enhanced LUCAS soil. The Member States thus supported should take the necessary
legal arrangements to ensure that the Commission can carry out such in-situ soil
sampling, including on privately owned fields, and in compliance with applicable
national or Union legislation.
(33) The Commission is developing remote sensing services in the context of Copernicus
as a user-driven programme, hereby also supporting Member States. In order to
increase the timeliness and effectiveness of soil health monitoring, and where relevant,
Member States should use remote sensing data including outputs from the Copernicus
services for monitoring relevant soil descriptors and for assessing soil health. The
Commission and the European Environment Agency should support exploring and
developing soil remote sensing products, to assist the Member States in monitoring the
relevant soil descriptors.
(34) Building on and upgrading the existing EU soil observatory, the Commission should
establish a digital soil health data portal that should be compatible with the EU Data
Strategy50 and the EU data spaces and which should be a hub providing access to soil
50 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European
Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on a European strategy for data,

data coming from various sources. That portal should primarily include all the data
collected by the Member States and the Commission as required by this Directive. It
should also be possible to integrate in the portal, on a voluntary basis, other relevant
soil data collected by Member States or any other party (and in particular data
resulting from projects under Horizon Europe and the Mission ‘A Soil Deal for
Europe’), provided that those data meet certain requirements as regards format and
specifications. Those requirements should be specified by the Commission by way of
implementing acts.
(35) It is also necessary to improve the harmonization of soil monitoring systems used in
the Member States and exploit the synergies between Union and national monitoring
systems in order to have more comparable data across the Union.
(36) In order to make the widest possible use of soil health data generated by the
monitoring carried out under this Directive, Member States should be required to
facilitate the access to such data for relevant stakeholders such as farmers, foresters,
land owners and local authorities.
(37) To maintain or enhance soil health, soils need to be managed sustainably. Sustainable
soil management will enable the long-term provision of soil services, including
improved air and water quality and food security. It is therefore appropriate to lay
down sustainable soil management principles to guide soil management practices.
(38) Economic instruments, including those under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)
that provide support to farmers, have a crucial role in the transition to the sustainable
management of agricultural soils and, to a lesser extent, forest soils. The CAP aims to
support soil health through the implementation of conditionality, eco-schemes and
rural development measures. Financial support for farmers and foresters who apply
sustainable soil management practices can also be generated by the private sector.
Voluntary sustainability labels in the food, wood, bio-based, and energy industry, for
example, established by private stakeholders, can take into account the sustainable soil
management principles set out in this Directive. This can enable food, wood, and other
biomass producers that follow those principles in their production to reflect these in
the value of their products. Additional funding for a network of real-life sites for
testing, demonstrating and upscaling of solutions, including on carbon farming, will be
provided through the Soil Mission’s living labs and lighthouses. Without prejudice to
the polluter pays principle, support and advice should be provided by Member States
to help landowners and land users affected by action taken under this Directive taking
into account, in particular, the needs and limited capacities of small and medium sized
enterprises.
(39) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 of the European Parliament and of the
Council51, Member States have to describe in their CAP Strategic Plans how the
environmental and climate architecture of those Plans is meant to contribute to the
achievement of, and be consistent with, the long-term national targets set out in, or
deriving from, the legislative acts listed in Annex XIII to that Regulation.

(40) In order to ensure that the best sustainable soil management practices are
implemented, Member States should be required to closely monitor the impact of soil
management practices and adjust practices and recommendations as necessary, taking
into account new knowledge from research and innovation. Valuable contributions are
expected in this respect from the Horizon Europe Mission ‘A Soil Deal for Europe’
and in particular its living labs and activities to support soil monitoring, soil education
and citizen engagement.
(41) Regeneration brings degraded soils back to healthy condition. When defining soil
regeneration measures, Member States should be required to take into account the
outcome of the soil health assessment and to adapt those regeneration measures to the
specific characteristics of the situation, the type, the use and the condition of the soil
and the local, climatic and environmental conditions.
(42) To ensure synergies between the different measures adopted under other Union
legislation that may have an impact on soil health, and the measures that are to be put
in place to sustainably manage and regenerate soils in the Union, Member States
should ensure that the sustainable soil management and regeneration practices are
coherent with the national restoration plans adopted in accordance with Regulation
(UE) …/… of the European Parliament and of the Council52+; the strategic plans to be
drawn up by Member States under the Common Agricultural Policy in accordance

and regeneration practices should be, as far as possible, integrated within these
programmes, plans and measures to the extent that they contribute to the achievement
of their objectives. Consequently, relevant indicators and data, such as soil-related
result indicators under the CAP Regulation and statistical data on agricultural input
and output reported under Regulation (EU) 2022/2379 of the European Parliament and
of the Council64, should be accessible to the competent authorities responsible for
sustainable soil management and regeneration practices and soil health assessment in
order to cross-link these data and indicators and thus enable the most accurate possible
assessment of the effectiveness of the measures chosen.
(43) Contaminated sites are the legacy of decades of industrial activity in the EU and may
lead to risks for human health and the environment now and in the future. It is
therefore necessary first to identify and investigate potentially contaminated sites and
then, in case of confirmed contamination, to assess the risks and take measures to
address unacceptable risks. Soil investigation may prove that a potentially
contaminated site is in fact not contaminated. In that case, the site should no longer be
labelled by the Member State as potentially contaminated, unless contamination is
suspected based on new evidence.
(44) To identify potentially contaminated sites, Member States should collect evidence
among others through historical research, past industrial incidents and accidents,
environmental permits and notifications by the public or authorities.
(45) In order to ensure that soil investigations on potentially contaminated sites are carried
out timely and effectively, Member States should, in addition to the obligation to lay
down the deadline by which those investigations should be carried out, be required to

lay down specific events that also trigger such investigation. Such triggering events
may include the request or review of an environmental or building permit or an
authorisation required pursuant to Union legislation or national legislation, soil
excavation activities, land use changes or land or real estate transactions. Soil
investigations may follow different stages, such as a desk study, site visit, preliminary
or exploratory investigation, more detailed or descriptive investigation, and field or
laboratory testing. Baseline reports and monitoring measures implemented in
accordance with Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the
Council65 could also qualify as soil investigation where appropriate.
(46) Flexibility for the management of potentially contaminated sites and contaminated
sites is needed to take account of costs, benefits and local specificities. Member States
should therefore at least adopt a risk-based approach for managing potentially
contaminated sites and contaminated sites, taking into account the difference between
these two categories, and which allows to allocate resources taking account of the
specific environmental, economic and social context. Decisions should be taken based
on the nature and extent of potential risks for human health and the environment
resulting from exposure to soil contaminants (e.g. exposure of vulnerable populations
such as pregnant women, persons with disabilities, elderly people and children). The
cost-benefit analysis of undertaking remediation should be positive. The optimum
remediation solution should be sustainable and selected through a balanced decision-
making process that takes account of the environmental, economic and social impacts.
The management of potentially contaminated sites and contaminated sites should
respect the polluter-pays, precautionary and proportionality principles. Member States
should lay down the specific methodology for determining the site-specific risks of
contaminated sites. Member States should also define what constitutes an
unacceptable risk from a contaminated site based on scientific knowledge, the
precautionary principle, local specificities, and current and future land use. In order to
reduce the risks of contaminated sites to an acceptable level for human health and the
environment, Member States should take adequate risk reduction measures including
remediation. It should be possible to qualify measures taken under other Union
legislation as risk reduction measures under this Directive when those measures
effectively reduce risks posed by contaminated sites.
(47) Measures taken pursuant to this Directive should also take account of other EU policy
objectives, such as the objectives pursued by [Regulation (EU) xxxx/xxxx66+] that aim
at ensuring secure and sustainable supply of critical raw materials for Europe’s
industry.
(48) Transparency is an essential component of soil policy and ensures public
accountability and awareness, fair market conditions and the monitoring of progress.
Therefore, Member States should set up and maintain a national register of
contaminated sites and potentially contaminated sites which contains site-specific
information that should be made publicly accessible in an online georeferenced spatial
database. The register should contain the information that is necessary for the public to

be informed on the existence and on the management of potentially contaminated sites
and contaminated sites. Because the presence of soil contamination is not yet
confirmed but only suspected on potentially contaminated sites, the difference between
contaminated sites and potentially contaminated sites has to be communicated and
explained well to the public to avoid raising unnecessary concern.
(49) Article 19(1) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) requires Member States to
provide remedies sufficient to ensure effective judicial protection in the fields covered
by Union law. In addition, in accordance with the Convention on access to
information, public participation in decision‐making and access to justice in
environmental matters67 (Aarhus Convention), members of the public concerned
should have access to justice in order to contribute to the protection of the right to live
in an environment which is adequate for personal health and well-being.
(50) Directive (EU) 2019/1024 of the European Parliament and of the Council68 mandates
the release of public sector data in free and open formats. The overall objective is to
continue the strengthening of the EU’s data economy by increasing the amount of
public sector data available for re-use, ensuring fair competition and easy access to
public sector information, and enhancing cross-border innovation based on data. The
main principle is that government data should be open by default and design. Directive
2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council69 is aimed at guaranteeing
the right of access to environmental information in the Member States in line with the
Aarhus Convention. The Aarhus Convention and Directive 2003/4/EC encompass
broad obligations related both to making environmental information available upon
request and actively disseminating such information. Directive 2007/2/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council70 is also of broad scope, covering the sharing
of spatial information, including data sets on different environmental topics. It is
important that provisions of this Directive related to access to information and data-
sharing arrangements complement those Directives and do not create a separate legal
regime. Therefore, the provisions of this Directive regarding information to the public
and information on monitoring of implementation should be without prejudice to
Directives (EU) 2019/1024, 2003/4/EC and 2007/2/EC.
(51) In order to ensure the necessary adaptation of the rules on soil health monitoring,
sustainable soil management and management of contaminated sites, the power to
adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the
European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending this
Directive to adapt to technical and scientific progress the methodologies for
monitoring soil health, the list of sustainable soil management principles, the
indicative list of risk reduction measures, the phases and requirements for the site-
specific risk assessment and the content of the register of contaminated and potentially
contaminated sites. It is of particular importance that the Commission carries out

appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and
that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in
the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making of 13 April 201671. In
particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the
European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as
Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of
Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.
(52) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive,
implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in order to set out the
format, structure and detailed arrangements for reporting data and information
electronically to the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance
with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and the Council72.
(53) The Commission should carry out an evidence-based evaluation and, where relevant, a
revision of this Directive, 6 years after its entry into force on the basis of the results of
the soil health assessment. The evaluation should assess in particular the need to set
more specific requirements to make sure unhealthy soils are regenerated and the
objective to achieve healthy soils by 2050 is achieved. The evaluation should also
assess the need to adapt the definition of healthy soils to scientific and technical
progress by adding provisions on certain descriptors or criteria based on new scientific
evidence relating to the protection of soils or on the grounds of a problem specific to a
Member State arising from new environmental or climatic circumstances. Pursuant to
paragraph 22 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making, that
evaluation should be based on the criteria of efficiency, effectiveness, relevance,
coherence and EU value added and should provide the basis for impact assessments of
possible further measures.
(54) Coordinated measures by all Member States are necessary to achieve the vision to
have all soils healthy by 2050 and to secure the provision of ecosystem services by
soils across the Union in the long-term. Individual actions of Member States have
proven to be insufficient since the soil degradation is continuing and even
deteriorating. Since the objectives of this Directive cannot be sufficiently achieved by
the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be
better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the
principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle
of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is
necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(55) In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member
States and the Commission on explanatory documents73, Member States have
undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition
measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the
components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition
instruments. With regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of
such documents to be justified.

1. FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE
1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative
Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on Soil
Monitoring and Resilience (Soil Monitoring Law).
1.2. Policy area(s) concerned
09 -Environment and Climate Action
Activities:
09 02 - Programme for Environment and Climate Action (LIFE)
1.3. The proposal/initiative relates to:
 a new action
 a new action following a pilot project/preparatory action83
 the extension of an existing action
 a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action
1.4. Objective(s)
1.4.1. General objective(s)
The objective of the proposed Directive is to contribute to address the big societal
challenges of:
- Achieving climate neutrality and becoming resilient to climate change
- Reversing biodiversity loss and fulfilling international commitments on biodiversity
- Reducing pollution to levels no longer considered harmful to human health and the
environment
- Fulfilling international commitments on land degradation neutrality
1.4.2. Specific objective(s)
Following from the general objective, the specific objective of this proposed
Directive is:
- To stop soil degradation and achieve healthy soils across the EU by 2050, so
ensuring that EU soils can supply multiple ecosystem services at a scale sufficient to
meet environmental, societal and economic needs, and reducing soil pollution to
levels no longer considered harmful to human health and the environment.
Following from the specific objective, the operational objectives are:
- To establish measures to stop degrading soils and regenerate soil health.
- To establish an effective framework to ensure implementation in particular by the
obligation for the Member States to assess soil health as well as for reporting and
review.
83 As referred to in Article 58(2)(a) or (b) of the Financial Regulation.
EN

EN
1.4.3. Expected result(s) and impact
Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.
The proposed intiative will deliver significant environmental benefits and improve
soil health with knock-on effects on the quality of both water and air, biodiversity,
climate benefits and food benefits. It addresses the risks to human health and the
environment coming from contaminated sites.
The welfare and well-being of current and future generations depends on soil health.
The implementation of the proposal is expected to create plenty of opportunities for
SMEs both for growth (e.g. investigation and remediation of contaminated sites,
advisory services for soil health, soil testing labs) and for innovation in the devise
and application of sustainable soil management and restoration measures, as well as
in relation to the investigation and remediation of contaminated soils.
The implementation of soil monitoring is also expected to create opportunities for
research and development and business to develop parameters and soil observation.
1.4.4. Indicators of performance
Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.
The implementation of the proposal should ensure that soils across the EU are
healthy by 2050 and that they are managed sustainable so that they do not further
deteriorate.
These are the main indicators foreseen to monitor the implementation:
- number of soil health monitoring points
- proportion of the EU territory where soils are in healthy status
- sustainable soil management measures adopted
- regeneration measures put in place
- number of potentially contaminated sites registered in the dedicated national
registers
- number of investigated potentially contaminated sites
- number of remediated or properly managed contaminated sites
1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative
1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for
roll-out of the implementation of the initiative
The proposed Directive will entry into force after its adoption but there will be a
transposition period of 2 years for the Member States to adopt and notify the laws,
regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
During this transposition period the Commission will assist Member States via:
- guidance document for the transposition of the Directive;
- development of various guidance and information material if need be regarding the
implementation of the Directive
- helpdesk function
EN
4
EN
After adoption of the Directive, the Commission:
- will regularly convene the specific new committee which will assist the
Commission as well as expert group meetings
- take the necessary steps and arrangements to update and put in place the LUCAS
soil programme which will complement the monitoring framework of the Member
States;
After expiration of the transposition deadline, the Commission will, in accordance
with its policy on the verification of the implementation of EU legislation:
- verify the completeness of the transposition measures notified by the Member
States and if need be may initiate infringement procedures;
- verify the conformity of the transposition measures Member States and if need be
may initiate infringement procedures.
After expiration of the transposition deadline, Member States will need:
to put in place the appropriate governance
to establish soil districts
to put in place the soil monitoring framework including the determination of
sampling points and adopting methodologies
to set up a register of potentially contaminated sites.
1.5.2. Added value of Union involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g.
coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For
the purposes of this point 'added value of Union involvement' is the value resulting
from Union intervention, which is additional to the value that would have been
otherwise created by Member States alone.
Reasons for action at European level (ex-ante)
Drivers and impacts of soil degradation exceed country borders and reduce the
provision of ecosystem services throughout the EU and its neighbours. National
action has proven to be insufficient to address soil degradation across the EU and has
led to divergent levels of protection of the environment and human health.
Expected generated EU added value (ex-post)
Coordinated action at EU level is expected to generate synergies, effectiveness and
efficiency gains for monitoring and restoring soil health and ensuring that soils are
managed in a sustainable way. Coordinated action is also expected to deliver on the
commitments that rely as well on soil health made in the EU and in the global
context, namely on addressing climate change, reverse biodiversity loss, aim at zero
pollution and achieve land degradation neutrality. Lastly, action at EU level is
expected to address potential distortions in the internal market and unfair competition
among businesses, since there are lower environmental requirements in some
Member States.

EN
1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past
In April 2002, the Commission announced for the first time its intention to develop a
Strategy for Soil Protection and to prepare the ground for a proposal for EU soil
legislation. A first proposal was subsequently adopted by the Commission in 2006
but difficult political discussions took place in the Council of the EU under
successive EU presidencies. No agreement was found due to a blocking minority of
five Member States. As a consequence, the Commission withdrew its proposal in
2014.
The debates showed that regulating soil at EU level can trigger resistance from
different stakeholder groups and Member States. Therefore, before preparing this
new initiative the Commission has invested extensively in meeting and consulting
stakeholders and Member States and some through the establishment of the EU
expert group on soil protection.
Particular attention was paid to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality
through sufficient flexibility. The proposal also takes largely into account of the
variability of soils, climatic conditions and land use.
A more result-oriented approach with clear targets and less focus on the process or
measures to be implemented provides more flexibility at national level, while still
satisfying the need for protecting soil coherently across the EU.
1.5.4. Compatibility with the Multiannual Financial Framework and possible synergies
with other appropriate instruments
The initiative falls under Heading 3 (Natural Resources and Environment), Title 9
(Environment and Climate Action) of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF)
2021-2027
The initiative falls under the umbrella of the European Green Deal. It also follows
from and contributes to achieving the ambitions set out in the EU Soil Strategy for
2030. The EU Soil Strategy is a key deliverable of the EU biodiversity strategy for
2030 and sets out a framework and concrete measures to protect and restore soils,
and ensure that they are used sustainably. It sets as well a vision and objectives to
achieve healthy soils by 2050, with concrete actions by 2030.
The proposal is complementary to other measures outlined in the Biodiversity
Strategy 2030 (such as the nature restoration law) and in the EU Soil Strategy (such
as the guidance on risk assessment, soil sealing and funding).
Implementation of the initiative by Member States and businesses will be supported
by a range of EU programmes such the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, the
European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the European Regional and
Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the Programme for the Environment and
Climate Action (LIFE), the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation
(Horizon Europe, HE) notably through the HE Mission “A Soil Deal for Europe”, the
Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), InvestEU, and national financing by EU
Member States and private funding.
EN

EN
1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for
redeployment
The implementation of the new Directive will entail new tasks and activities for the
Commission. This will require human resources, EEA support, procurement
resources for external contractors and one or more administrative arrangement with
JRC.
There is currently no dedicated existing EU binding instrument on soil and the
implementation and monitoring of the Directive are therefore new responsabilities
for the Commission and the Member States.
This requires additional resources with high capacity of political judgement, policy
knowledge, analytical skills, independence and resilience throughout the long-term
implementation of the legislation. Additional expert support will be equally needed,
also through outsourcing, where possible, but core tasks that involve a high degree of
political sensitivity need to be carried out by the Commission.
