    thisalinea.textcontent.append("The main limitation that we encountered during our data analysis was the accuracy")
    thisalinea.textcontent.append("of the sieve-slit correction. This accuracy was limited due to several reasons. The ﬁrst")
    thisalinea.textcontent.append("reason is that data were only available for 5 distinct holes in the horizontal direction.")
    thisalinea.textcontent.append("Therefore, the knowledge on how to construct the horizontal scattering angle θt was")
    thisalinea.textcontent.append("limited, which was demonstrated very well by the curls in Figures 4.6a and 4.6b at")
    thisalinea.textcontent.append("the extremes of θt. However, from Figure 4.5a it is clear that the horizontal angular")
    thisalinea.textcontent.append("resolution could easily allow for a greater number of holes in the sieve slit in the")

    thisalinea.textcontent.append("sieve slit in the region of −0.85◦ ≤ θt ≤ 0.85◦.")
    thisalinea.textcontent.append("The second reason is that sieve-slit data were only taken in the 0◦ mode. One could")
    thisalinea.textcontent.append("argue that the optical properties of Grand Raiden in other modes are identical to")
    thisalinea.textcontent.append("the 0◦ mode, but the kinematics of the reaction at the target are not. Therefore,")
    thisalinea.textcontent.append("the trajectories of ions will always be diﬀerent for diﬀerent angular modes, which")
    thisalinea.textcontent.append("will result in slight diﬀerences in how ion tracks should be traced back to the target.")
    thisalinea.textcontent.append("Hence, 0◦ sieve-slit data can never truly replace sieve-slit data taken in some other")
    thisalinea.textcontent.append("mode. This is also illustrated in Figures 4.6a and 4.6b. The data from the 2.5◦")

    thisalinea.textcontent.append("Hence, we recommend that for future experiments, independent sieve-slit data be")
    thisalinea.textcontent.append("taken for all angular modes that will be used during the experiment.")
    thisalinea.textcontent.append("The third reason is the beam tuning between diﬀerent experimental runs. During")
    thisalinea.textcontent.append("our experiment, the angle between the beam and the target was slightly changed")
    thisalinea.textcontent.append("each time the beam was tuned, and no record was available about the exact beam")
    thisalinea.textcontent.append("angles per run. Hence, we were forced to use the 3He+ peak to determine these")
    thisalinea.textcontent.append("properties. Fortunately, this works very well for 0◦ runs. However, for other runs,")
    thisalinea.textcontent.append("we were forced to assume the same beam angles as the last 0◦ run without any clue")
    thisalinea.textcontent.append("whether this was correct or not. Moreover, even for the 0◦ runs, beam angles could")
    thisalinea.textcontent.append("only be reconstructed from the 3He+ peak after the sieve-slit correction was done,")
