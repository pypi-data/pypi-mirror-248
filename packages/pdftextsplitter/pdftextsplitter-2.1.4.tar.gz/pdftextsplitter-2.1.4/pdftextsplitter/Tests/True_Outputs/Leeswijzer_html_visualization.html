Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young
man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a
chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed
with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and
some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week. Not all that Mrs.
Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject,
was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.
