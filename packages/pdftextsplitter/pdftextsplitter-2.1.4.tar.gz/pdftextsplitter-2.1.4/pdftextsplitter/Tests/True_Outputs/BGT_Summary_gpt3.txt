Accurate measurements of Gamow-Teller strength distributions are important in nuclear structure, neutrino physics, and nucleosynthesis. The Gamow-Teller strength distribution is used to obtain information about the nuclear wave function and is characterized in terms of a B(GT) value. This value can be directly extracted from measurable observables and provides the Gamow-Teller strength for the final state in the daughter nucleus. Accurate measurements of B(GT) values help to understand nucleosynthesis for elements heavier than iron and can also be used to design new detection techniques of solar neutrinos. The article describes the data analysis procedure used to extract the B(GT) values for low-lying states in the excitation-energy spectrum of 116Sn and 122Sn targets. The efficiency of the MWDC layer was defined, and the numbers N4 and N3 were determined for each bin in θ and for each individual run. The differential cross sections were determined per excitation-energy bin of 200 keV, and the ΔL = 0 components were extracted from the differential cross sections with a Multipole-Decomposition Analysis (MDA). The Gamow–Teller strength distributions were obtained for two different situations, with and without subtracting the quasi-free background. The article discusses the comparison of the Gamow-Teller strength distributions in the Sn(3He,t)Sb reaction for several isotopes, including 116Sn and 122Sn, at a beam energy of 67 MeV/u. The study compares the data presented in this paper to those published in Refs. [22] and [24]. The comparison shows a significant deviation between the present data and those of Pham et al. for the IAS and GT1 of the 122Sn target. The deviation in GT1 could be a result of systematic uncertainties in the fitting procedure of Fig. 17. The article discusses the results of experiments measuring the Gamow-Teller strength distribution in the nuclei 116Sn and 122Sn. The authors compare their results to previous measurements and theoretical calculations, and discuss the issue of subtracting the quasi-free background from the data. They also note the need for further research to accurately determine the contribution of the quasi-free background to the Gamow-Teller strength distribution. The article discusses the measurement of Gamow-Teller strength distributions of 116,122 Sn → 116,122 Sb using the (3 He, t) charge-exchange reaction at a bombarding energy of 140 MeV/u. The results were compared with previous measurements at a lower incident energy of 67 MeV/u. The data was also compared to 150 Nd → 150 Pm data and to QRPA+QPVC calculations. The article suggests that more research is needed to better understand the general quenching phenomenon, and measurement techniques are needed to determine the size of the quasi-free background.
