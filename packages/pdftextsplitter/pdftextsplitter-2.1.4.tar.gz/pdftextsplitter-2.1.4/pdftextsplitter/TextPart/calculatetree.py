    This function calculates the parentID and horizontal ordering of the 
    textalineas-array in the textsplitter-class. It is meant to be called
    AFTER the breakdown-function, as this function needs a filled
    textalineas-array with calculated cascade levels to work. It calculates
    parentID & horizontal ordering based on the order of the textalineas
    in the array, as this corresponds to the order in which they occur
    in the document.
