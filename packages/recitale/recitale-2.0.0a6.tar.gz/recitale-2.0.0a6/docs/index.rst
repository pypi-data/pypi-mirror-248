More or less a small clone of exposure.co in form of a static website generator. 
For those of you who don't know what exposure.co is, it allows you to tell a story with your pictures.

recitale is a contraction of `tale` and the French word `récit` which are both depicting the same thing: a story.

It is also a play on `recital` which is related to poetry reading.

recitale should be pronounced /ʁe.siˈteɪl/ that is, the French pronounciation for `récit <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/r%C3%A9cit#Pronunciation>`__ followed
by the English pronounciation of `tale <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tale#Pronunciation>`__.
