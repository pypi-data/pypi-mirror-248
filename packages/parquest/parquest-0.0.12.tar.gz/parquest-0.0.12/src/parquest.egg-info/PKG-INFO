# Parquest

Parquest is a project that aims to structure raw data into a structured format based on the Parquet file format. The name "Parquest" is a portmanteau of "Parquet" and "quest," symbolizing the journey of transforming raw data into a structured format.

## Introduction

In today's data-driven world, dealing with large volumes of raw data can be challenging. The Parquest project provides a solution by leveraging the power of the Parquet file format to structure and organize raw data efficiently.

## Features

- **Data Structuring**: Parquest enables you to convert raw data into a structured format based on the Parquet file format.
- **Efficient Storage**: The Parquet file format is designed for efficient storage and retrieval of structured data, making it ideal for big data applications.
- **Columnar Storage**: Parquest stores data in a columnar format, which allows for faster query performance and better compression ratios.
- **Schema Evolution**: Parquest supports schema evolution, allowing you to easily modify the structure of your data over time without breaking compatibility.
