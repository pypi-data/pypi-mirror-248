# hy
# hy - the "Hey, You!" program

`hy` is a simple program that prints out "Hey, You!" by default without any arguments. However, if you provide a language code, such as `hy IT`, it will print the version of "Hey, You!" in that language.

Currently, `hy` supports the following languages:
- English (EN)
- Spanish (ES)
- French (FR)
- German (DE)
- Italian (IT)

To use `hy` with a specific language, simply provide the language code as an argument. For example, to print "Hey, You!" in Italian, run `hy IT`.

Enjoy using `hy` and spreading greetings in different languages!
