# Handheld Daemon (HHD)
Handheld Daemon is a project that aims to provide utilities for managing handheld
devices.
With features ranging from TDP controls, to controller remappings, and gamescope 
session management.
This is done through a plugin system, and a dbus daemon, which will expose the
settings of the plugins in a UI agnostic way.

For the time being, the daemon is not d-bus based, and relies on static configuration
stored on `~/.config/hhd`.
The current version contains a fully functional Dual Sense 5 Edge emulator for
the Legion Go (including touchpad, gyro, and LED support).
It is the aim of this project to provide generic hid-based emulators for most
mainstream controllers (xbox Elite, DS4, DS5, Joycons), so that users of devices
can pick the best target for their device and its controls, which may change
depending on the game.

*Current Features*:
- Fully functional Dual Sense 5 Emulator (Legion Go)
    - All buttons supported
    - Rumble feedback
    - Touchpad support (steam input as well)
    - LED remapping
- Power Button plugin
    - Short press makes steam deck sleep
    - Long press opens steam power menu

*Upcoming v0.2 Features*
- Hiding the original xbox controller!
- HTTP based Configuration
  - Right now, functionality can be tweaked through config files
    - Not ideal for a portable device
  - An HTTP daemon and a plugin system will allow safe, polkit based
    access to hardware configuration.
  - Profiles will allow swapping configuration per game.

*Planned Features (in that order)*:
- Evdev device emulation
  - No weird glyphs
  - But partial gyro and back button support
- Steam Deck controller emulation
  - No weird glyphs
- TDP Plugin (Legion Go)
  - Will provide parity with Legion Space, hardware is already reverse engineered
- High-end Over/Downclocking Utility for Ryzen processors
  - By hooking into the manufacturer ACPI API of the Ryzen platform,
    it will expose all TDP related parameters manufacturers have access to
    when spec'ing laptops.
  - RyzenAdj Successor
    - No memory-relaxed requirement
    - Safer, as it is the method used by manufacturers
        (provided you stay within limits).
  - May require DSDT patch on boot, TBD.

## Installation Instructions
You can install the latest stable version of `hhd` from AUR or PiPy.

### ChimeraOS
ChimeraOS does not ship with `gcc` to compile hhd dependencies and the functionality
of `handygccs` which fixes the QAM button by default conflicts with hhd.
The easiest way to install is to unlock the filesystem, install hhd, and remove
handygccs.

```bash
# Unlock filesystem
sudo frzr-unlock

# Run installer
sudo pacman -S base-devel
sudo pikaur -S hhd
sudo pacman -R handygccs-git

# Enable and reboot
sudo systemctl enable hhd@$(whoami)
sudo reboot
```

Then, repeat every time you update Chimera. As a bonus, you will get new HHD
features as well ðŸ˜Š.

#### Uninstall
Just run the steps in reverse or switch to a locked Chimera version.
```bash
sudo systemctl disable hhd@$(whoami)

sudo pikaur -S handygccs-git
sudo pacman -R hhd

sudo systemctl enable handygccs
sudo reboot
```

### PyPi Based installation (Nobara/Read only fs)
If you have a read only fs or are on a fedora based system, you may opt to install
a local version of hhd.
```bash
# (nobara) Install Python Headers since evdev has no wheels
# and nobara does not ship them (but arch does)
sudo dnf install python-devel

# Install hhd to ~/.local/share/hhd
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/hhd
cd ~/.local/share/hhd

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install hhd

# Install udev rules and create a service file
sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antheas/hhd/master/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/83-hhd.rules -o /etc/udev/rules.d/83-hhd.rules 
sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antheas/hhd/master/usr/lib/systemd/system/hhd_local%40.service -o /etc/systemd/system/hhd_local@.service

# Start service and reboot
sudo systemctl enable hhd_local@$(whoami)
sudo reboot
```

#### Update Instructions
Of course, you will want to update HHD to catch up to latest features
```bash
sudo systemctl stop hhd_local@$(whoami)
~/.local/share/hhd/venv/bin/pip install --upgrade hhd
sudo systemctl start hhd_local@$(whoami)
```

#### Uninstall instructions
To uninstall, simply stop the service and remove the added files.
```bash
sudo systemctl disable hhd_local@$(whoami)
sudo systemctl stop hhd_local@$(whoami)
rm -rf ~/.local/share/hhd
sudo rm /etc/udev/rules.d/83-hhd.rules
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/hhd_local@.service
# Delete your configuration
rm -r ~/.config/hhd
```

> The above should work on read only fs, provided the /etc directory is not read
> only.

### Arch-based Installation (AUR)
```bash
# Install using your AUR package manager
sudo pikaur -S hhd
sudo yay -S hhd
sudo pacman -S hhd # manjaro only

# Enable and reboot
sudo systemctl enable hhd@$(whoami)
sudo reboot
```

But I dont want to reboot...
```bash
# Reload hhd's udev rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
# Restart iio-proxy-service to stop it
# from polling the accelerometer
sudo systemctl restart iio-sensor-proxy
# Start the service for your user
sudo systemctl start hhd@$(whoami)
```

> To ensure the gyro of the Legion Go and other devices with AMD SFH runs smoothly, 
> a udev rule is included that disables the use of the accelerometer by the 
> system (e.g., iio-sensor-proxy).
> This limitation will be lifted in the future, if a new driver is written for
> amd-sfh.

#### Updating/Uninstalling in Arch
HHD will update automatically with your system from then on, or you can update it
manually with your AUR package manager.
To uninstall, just uninstall the package and reboot.

```bash
# Update using your AUR package manager
sudo pikaur -S hhd
sudo yay -S hhd
sudo pacman -S hhd # manjaro only

# Remove to uninstall
sudo pacman -R hhd
sudo reboot
```

## Configuring HHD
The reason you added your username to the hhd service was to bind the hhd daemon
to your user.
This allows HHD to add configuration files with appropriate permissions to your
user dir, which is the following:
```bash
~/.config/hhd
```

The global configuration for hhd is found in:
```bash
~/.config/hhd/state.yml
```
This will allow you to set sticky hhd configuration options, such as emulation
mode.
Once set, hhd will hot-reload the configurations.

HHD allows you to create profiles, that set multiple configurations together,
through the profile directory:
```bash
~/.config/hhd/profiles
```

Right now, these profiles can only be set with the experimental HTTP API,
which will be called through a GUI.
This API is disabled by default in the current version of HHD.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
### What does the current version of HHD do?
The current version of HHD maps the x-input mode of the legion go controllers to
a Dualsense 5 Edge controller, which allows using all of the controller functions.
In addition, it adds support for the steam powerbutton action, so you get a wink
when going to sleep mode.
When the controllers are not in x-input mode, HHD adds a shortcuts device so
that combos such as Steam and QAM keep working.

### I'm seeing three X-BOX controllers, regardless of whether HHD is running
Currently, there is a bug with the Nobara kernels that adds 2 extra random
Steam Controllers.
These controllers appear in the system as X-BOX/Xpad controllers.
This is unrelated to HHD.

### Steam reports a Legion Controller and a Shortcuts controller instead of a DS5
The Legion controllers have multiple modes (namely x-input, d-input, dual d-input,
and FPS).
HHD only remaps the x-input mode of the controllers.
You can cycle through the modes with Legion L + RB.

X-input and d-input refer to the protocol the controllers operate in.
Both are legacy protocols introduced in the mid-2000s and are included for hardware
support reasons.

X-input is a USB controller protocol introduced with the xbox 360 controller and 
is widely supported.
Direct input is a competing protocol that works based on USB HID.
Both work the same.
The only difference between them is that d-input has discrete triggers for some
reason, and some games read the button order wrong.

X-input requires a special udev rule to work, see below.

### Other gamepad modes
HHD remaps the xinput mode of the Legion Go controllers into a DS5 controller.
All other modes function as normal.
In addition, HHD adds a shortcuts device that allows remapping the back buttons
and all Legion L, R + button combinations into shortcuts that will work accross
all modes.

### I can not see any controllers before or after installing HHD
You are in a distro that does not officially support Legion Go.
One of the fixes that is included in those distros is a udev rule that binds
the xpad driver to the controllers.
This is expected to be included in a future linux kernel so it is not included
by default by HHD.

Under `/etc/udev/rules.d/95-hhd.rules` add the following:
```bash
# Enable XPAD for the legion go controllers
ATTRS{idVendor}=="17ef", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6182", RUN+="/sbin/modprobe xpad" RUN+="/bin/sh -c 'echo 17ef 6182 > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/xpad/new_id'"
```

You will see the following in the HHD logs (`sudo systemctl status hhd@$(whoami)`)
if you are missing the xpad rule.
```
              ERROR    Device with the following not found:                                                                                                                          evdev.py:122
                       Vendor ID: ['17ef']
                       Product ID: ['6182']
                       Name: ['Generic X-Box pad']
```

### I can see the original controller and that is causing issues in X
Hiding the original controller is a complex process, so it was skipped for the
v0.1.* versions of HHD.
However, it is implemented properly in v0.2 which will be released soon.
Some emulators select the original controller as controller 1, which might
cause issues.
If this is the case, wait for version 2.

### Yuzu does not work with the DS5 controller
See above.
Use yuzu controller settings to select the dual sense controller and disable 
steam input.

### Playstation Driver
There is a small touchpad issue with the playstation driver loaded.
Where a cursor might appear when using the touchpad in steam input.
This should be fixed in the latest version.
If not, you can fix it by blacklisting the playstation driver.
However, you will get a lot of issues if you dont exclusively use steam input 
afterwards so do not do it otherwise.
You will not be able to use the touchpad as a touchpad anymore and that is the
only way to wake up the screen in desktop mode.
Games that do not support Dual Sense natively (e.g., wine games) will not have
a correct gamepad profile and will not work either.
```bash
sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antheas/hhd/master/usr/lib/modprobe.d/hhd.conf -o /etc/udev/modprobe.d/hhd.conf
```

### Freezing Gyro
The gyro used for the DS5 controller is found in the display.
It may freeze occasionally. This is due to the accelerometer driver being
designed to be polled at 5hz, not 100hz.
If that is the case, you need to reboot.

The gyro may exhibit stutters when being polled by `iio-sensor-proxy` to determine
screen orientation.
However, a udev rule that is installed by default disables this.

If you do not need gyro support, you should disable it for a .2% cpu utilisation
reduction.
By default, the accelerometer is disabled for this reason.

You need to set both `gyro` and `gyro-fix` to `False` in the config to disable
gyro support.

### No screen autorotation after install
HHD includes a udev rule that disables screen autorotation, because it interferes
with gyro support.
This is only done specifically to the accelerometer of the legion go.
If you do not need gyro, you can do the local install and modify
`83-hhd.rules` to remove that rule.
The gyro will freeze and will be unusable after that.

### Touchpad right click does not work in desktop
HHD remaps the touchpad of the legion go to the DS5 touchpad.
The playstation driver does not support right clicking.
Switch to d-input to enable the touchpad when you're in the desktop.
Next HHD version includes an option for disabling touchpad emulation.

### HandyGCCS
HHD replicates all functionality of HandyGCCS for the Legion Go, so it is not
required. In addition, it will break HHD by hiding the controller.
You should uninstall it with `sudo pacman -R handygccs-git`.

You will see the following in the HHD logs (`sudo systemctl status hhd@$(whoami)`) 
if handygccs is enabled.
```
              ERROR    Device with the following not found:                                                                                                                          evdev.py:122
                       Vendor ID: ['17ef']
                       Product ID: ['6182']
                       Name: ['Generic X-Box pad']
```

### Buttons are mapped incorrectly
Buttons mapped in legion space will carry over to linux.
This includes both back buttons and legion swap.
You can reset each controller by holding Legion R + RT + RB, Legion L + LT + LB.
However, we do not know how to reset the legion space legion button swap at
this point, so you need to use Legion Space for that.

Another set of obscure issues occur depending on how apps hook to the DS5 controller.
If the playstation driver is not active, the linux kernel creates an evdev node
with incorrect mappings (right trigger becomes a stick, etc).
If the app hooks directly into the hidraw of the controller, it works properly.
If it uses the evdev device its incorrect.
