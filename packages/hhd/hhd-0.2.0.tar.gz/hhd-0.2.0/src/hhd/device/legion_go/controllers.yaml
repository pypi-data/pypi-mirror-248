    title: Touchpad correction type
    hint: >-
      The legion touchpad is square, whereas the DS5 one is rectangular.
      Therefore, it needs to be corrected.
      "Contain" maintain the whole DS5 touchpad and part of the Legion
      one is unused. "Crop" uses the full legion touchpad, and limits
      the area of the DS5. "Stretch" uses both fully (distorted).
      "Crop End" enables use in steam input as the right touchpad.
      Set to "Disabled" to not remap.
    options:
      disabled: "Disabled"
      stretch: "Stretch"
      crop_center: "Crop Center"
      crop_start: "Crop Start"
      crop_end: "Crop End"
