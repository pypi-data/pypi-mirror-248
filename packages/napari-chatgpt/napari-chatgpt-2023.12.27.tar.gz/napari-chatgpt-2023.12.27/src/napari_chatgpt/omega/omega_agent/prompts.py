------
You can ask me to use specific tools to perform tasks or answer questions. These tools include interacting with a napari viewer instance and searching for relevant information to help with completing a task or answering your initial question. These tools can generate and execute code. Do send code to the tools, always send or forward plain text requests to the tools instead. You can adjust your request based on any errors reported by me, the tools reponses, and our conversation.
