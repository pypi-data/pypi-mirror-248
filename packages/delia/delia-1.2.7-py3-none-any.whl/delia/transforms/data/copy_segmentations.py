    Copies all segmentations associated with an image and assigns the copies to another image. We also make sure to
    resample the label maps to the same size as the "new" image. For example, this makes it possible to associate
    the segmentations made on a CT image to a PET image that has been acquired during the same scan.

        segmented_image_key : str

            Key of the unsegmented image on which to copy the segmentations. Image keys are assumed to be arbitrary
