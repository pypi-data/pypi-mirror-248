# Car Segmentation Package

## Overview
The Car-segmentation package is developed to facilitate the removal of both internal and external backgrounds from car images. This package comprises two distinct models:

### External Model:

**Purpose:** Removes the background external to cars.

**Performance:** Known for its effectiveness in this task.

### Internal Model:

**Purpose:** Removes the background internal to cars.

**Note:** This task involves innovation, where a dataset was collected, and a deep learning model was trained. The achieved accuracy is 75%, which is considered moderate. Keep in mind that sentiment analysis provided suboptimal results.

## Usage
### External Model Usage
To use the external model for removing the background external to cars, employ the following code:
```bash
from carbgremover.external_model import remove_background_external, plot_image
# Parameters:
# image_path: path to the image
# device: "cpu" (default) or "cuda" if you have GPU
res = remove_background_external(image_path='car1.jpg', device="cpu")
plot_image(res, figsize=(15, 15))

```
Input image:
![Car Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nechba/SegmentCar/main/carbgremover/images/car1.jpg)


Output image:
![Car Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nechba/SegmentCar/main/carbgremover/images/rescar1.jpg)
For saving the image, use the following:
```bash
import cv2
cv2.imwrite('rescar2.jpg', res)
```

### Internal Model Usage
For the internal model designed to remove the background internal to cars, utilize the following code
```bash
from carbgremover.internal_model import remove_background_internal,plot_image

res = remove_background_internal('car2.jpg')
plot_image(res, figsize=(15, 15))
```

Input image:
![Car Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nechba/SegmentCar/main/carbgremover/images/car2.jpg)

Output image:
![Car Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nechba/SegmentCar/main/carbgremover/images/rescar2.jpg)

For saving the image, use the following:
```bash
import cv2

res = cv2.cvtColor(res, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)
cv2.imwrite('rescar2.jpg', res)
```
