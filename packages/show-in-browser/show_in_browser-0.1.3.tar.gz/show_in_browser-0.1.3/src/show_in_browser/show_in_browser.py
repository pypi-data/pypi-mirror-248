    """Show a pandas dataframe in the default browser, from the command line.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pandas DataFrame (can also be a Series)
        The DataFrame (or Series) to be displayed in the browser.

    name : str
        The name of the temporary HTML file generated (which contains the 
        information from the dataframe). This is useful for keeping track of 
        what the dataframe shows if you are opening multiple tabs showing
        different dataframes. In most browsers the name of the temporary file
        will be displayed on the tab that displays that particular dataframe.
        You may want to use names like "control_group" etc. to make it clearer
        what information is shown on the dataframe in that tab. Note: the name
        supplied does NOT need a file extension.

    decimal_places: int
        Temporarily set what how many decimal places to show numbers to. Default
        is 3.

    delete : Bool
        Boolean indicating whether to delete the temporary HTML file after
        it is shown in the browser. Default is True.    

    delete_pause : Bool
        Number indicate how long to wait before deleting the temporary HTML file.
        You may want to change this if your browser is taking a long time
        to open the file (e.g. so it is getting deleted before it is shown).
        Default is 1 second.

     Works like plt.show() - run it after your plotting commands. Or, if you 
     have saved your plot as a variable (e.g. called `my_plot`) then you can
     pass it to this function using the argument `show_plt_plot(fig=my_plot)`.

    Parameters
    ----------

    fig: matplotlib.figure.Figure
        The matplotlib graph object which you want to open in a browser. 
        If no figure is supplied, then the current figure will be shown.
        Default is None.

    name : str
        The name of the temporary HTML file generated (which contains the 
        plot). Note: the name supplied does NOT need a file extension.

    delete : Bool
        Boolean indicating whether to delete the temporary HTML file after
        it is shown in the browser. Default is True.    
        
    delete_pause : Bool

        You may want to change this if your browser is taking a long time
        to open the file (e.g. so it is getting deleted before it is shown).
        Default is 1 second. 
    
    interact : Bool
        Set whether to display your matplotlib plot(s) interactively (e.g. so
        you can rotate a 3D scatterplot). NOTE: we **strongly** recommend using
        plotly if you want interactive plots - you will have to change the
        matplotlib backend to 'WebAgg' if you want to use matplotlib. If using
        matplotlib interactively, you should only run `show_plt_plot()` once
        and all your plots will be shown in the same tab (e.g. you do not have
        to run it for each separate plot). Default is False.
