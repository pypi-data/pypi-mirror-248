# Cloudmesh ee

A general purpose HPC Template and Experiment management system


## Background

Hyper Performance Computation Clusters (HPCs) are designed around a
timesharing principle and are powered by queue-based execution
ecosystems such as SchedMD's
[SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html) and IBM's Platform
Load Sharing Facility
([LSF](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-lsf/10.1.0?topic=overview-lsf-introduction)).
While these ecosystems provide a great deal of control and extension
for planning, scheduling, and batching jobs, they are limited in their
ability to support parameterization in a scheduled task.  While there
are facilities in place to execute jobs on an Array, the ability to do
permutation based experments are limited to what you integrate into
your own batch script.  Even then, parameterization of values are only
made availabile as environment variables, which can be limited
depending on your OS or selected programming language.  In many cases
limitations set by the deployment trhough the compute center also
hinder optimal use while restrictions are placed on duration and
number of parallel accessible resources. In some cases these
restrictions are soo established that removing them is impractical and
takes weks to implement on temporary basis.

Cloudmesh Experiment Executor (ee) is a framework that wraps the SLURM 
batch processor into a templated framework such that experiments can 
be generated based on configuration files focusing on the livecycle 
of generating many permutations of experiments with standard tooling, 
so that you can focus more on modeling your experiments than how to 
orchestrate them with tools.  A number of batch scripts can be 
generated that than can be executed according to center policies.

## Dependencies

When you install cloudmesh-ee, you will also be installing a
minimum baseline of the `cms` command (as part of the Cloudmesh
ecosystem).  For more details on Cloudmesh, see its documentation on
[read the docs](https://cloudmesh.github.io/cloudmesh-manual/). However
all instalation can be done thorugh pip. After instalation, you will
need to initialize cloudmesh with the command

```bash
$ cms help
```

While SLURM is not needed to run the `cloudmesh ee` command, the
generated output will not execute unless your system has slurm installed
and you are able to run jobs via the `slurm sbatch` command.

## Documentation

### Running Cloudmesh ee

The `cloudmesh ee` command takes one of two forms of execution.  It is started with 

```bash
$ cms ee <command> <parameters>
```

Where the command invokes a partiuclar action and parameters include a
number of parameters for the command These commands allow you to
inspect the generated output to confirm your parameterization
functions as expected and as intended.

In general, configuration arguments that appear in multiple locations are
prioritized in the following order (highest priority first)

1. CLI Arguments with `cms ee`
2. Configuration Files
3. Preset values

### Generating Experiments with the CLI

The `generate` command is used to generate your experiments based upon either a passed
configuration file, or via CLI arguments.  You can issue the command using
either of the below forms:

```text
cms ee generate SOURCE --name=NAME [--verbose] [--mode=MODE] [--config=CONFIG] [--attributes=PARAMS] [--out=DESTINATION] [--dryrun] [--noos] [--nocm] [--dir=DIR] [--experiment=EXPERIMENT]
cms ee generate --setup=FILE [SOURCE] [--verbose] [--mode=MODE]  [--config=CONFIG] [--attributes=PARAMS] [--out=DESTINATION] [--dryrun] [--noos] [--nocm] [--dir=DIR] [--experiment=EXPERIMENT] [--name=NAME]
```

If you have prepared a configuration file that conforms to the schema
defined in [Setup Config](#setup-config), then you can use the second
form which overrides the default values.

* `--name=NAME` - Supplies a name for this experiment.  Note that the name
  must not match any existing files or directories where you are currently
  executing the command
* `--verbose` - Enables additional logging useful when troubleshooting the
  program.
* `--mode=MODE` - specifies how the output should be generated.  One of: f,h,d.
  * `f` or `flat` - specifies a "flat" mode, where slurm scripts are generated in a flattened structure, all in one directory.
  * `h` or `hierarchical` - specifies a "hierarchical" mode, where experiments are nested into unique directories from each other.
  * `d` or `debug` - instructs the command to not generate any output.
* `--config=CONFIG` - specifies key-value pairs to be used across all files for substitution.  This can be a python, yaml, or json file.
* `--attributes=PARAMS` - specifies key-value pairs that can be listed at the command line and used as substitution across all experiments.  Note this command leverages [cloudmesh's parameter expansion specification](https://cloudmesh.github.io/cloudmesh-manual/autoapi/cloudmeshcommon/cloudmesh/common/parameter/index.html) for different types of expansion rules.
* `--out=DESTINATION` - specifies the directory to write the generated scripts out to.
* `--dryrun` - Runs the command without performing any operations
* `--noos` - Prevents the interleaving of OS environemnt variables into the subsitution logic
* `--dir=DIR` - specifies the directory to write the generated scripts out to.
* `--experiment=EXPERIMENT` - specifies a listing of key-value parameters that establish a unique experiment for each combination of values (a cartisian product across all values for each key).

* `--setup=FILE` - provides all the above configuration options within a configuration
  file to simplify executions.

### Form 2 - Generating Submission Scripts

```text
ee generate submit --name=NAME [--verbose]
```

This command uses the output of the
[generate command](#command-1---generating-experiments) and generates
a shell script that can be used to submit your previously generated
outputs to SLURM as a sequence of sbatch commands.

* `--name=NAME` - specifies the name used in the
  [generate command](#command-1---generating-experiments).
  The generate command will inspect the `<NAME>.json` file and build the
  necessary commands to run all permutations that the cloudmesh ee
  command generated.

Note that this command only generates the script, and you must run the
outputted file in your shell for the commands to be issued to SLURM and
run your jobs.


**Sample YAML File**

This command requires a YAML file which is configured for the host and gpu.
The YAML file also points to the desired slurm template.

```yaml
slurm_template: 'slurm_template.slurm'

ee_setup:
  <hostname>-<gpu>:
    - card_name: "a100"
    - time: "05:00:00"
    - num_cpus: 6
    - num_gpus: 1

  rivanna-v100:
    - card_name: "v100"
    - time: "06:00:00"
    - num_cpus: 6
    - num_gpus: 1

```

example:

```
cms ee slurm.in.sh --config=a.py,b.json,c.yaml --attributes=a=1,b=4  --noos --dir=example --experiment=\"epoch=[1-3] x=[1,4] y=[10,11]\"
ee slurm.in.sh --config=a.py,b.json,c.yaml --attributes=a=1,b=4 --noos --dir=example --experiment="epoch=[1-3] x=[1,4] y=[10,11]"
