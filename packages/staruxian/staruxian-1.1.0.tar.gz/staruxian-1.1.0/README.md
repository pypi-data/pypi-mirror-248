# Staruxian Python Library

Welcome to the Staruxian Python Library, a collection of convenient functions developed by Khurshed for Python projects. To install the Staruxian library, use pip: `pip install staruxian`. This library includes two main functions:

### `print_ln()`
The `print_ln()` function prints something several time which you entered.


```python
from staruxian import print_ln

print_ln(3, "Hello Staruxian!")
# Output:
# Hello Staruxian!
# Hello Staruxian!
# Hello Staruxian!
