Installation
------------

``pip install dixit``

Starting the Server
-------------------

``dixit``

Then go to http://localhost:8888/.

Configuring the Server
----------------------

Configuration options, such as the port (default 8888), and the location of
each card deck (e.g., see ``dixit/static/cards/dixit/README.txt``), are housed
in JSON configuration files that are read when you launch the server.
Default settings are located in ``dixit/config.json``.

To override the defaults, you may create a JSON file in your working directory
that contains a subset of these configuration options. For example, to change
the port to 9000, create a new file named ``config.local.json`` that contains:

.. code-block:: JSON

   {
       "port": 9000
   }

Then pass in this file name when you launch the server, as in:
``dixit config.local.json``. This will override the default configuration with
the values in ``config.local.json``.

Alternatively, directly edit ``dixit/config.json``, to for instance, specify
which port to use, or to point to the location of each card deck that you have.
