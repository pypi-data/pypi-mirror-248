<p>AMPS has the ability to replicate messages to downstream AMPS instances
once those messages are stored to a transaction log. Replication in AMPS
involves the configuration of two or more instances designed to share
some or all of the published messages. With AMPS replication, an
upstream (or source) instance delivers messages to
a downstream instance.</p>
<p>Replication is typically used to improve the availability of a
set of AMPS instances by creating a set of servers that hold
the same messages, where each server can take over for the
others in the event of a network or server failure.</p>
<p>Since AMPS replication operates on individual messages,
replication is also an efficient way to split and share message
streams between multiple sites where each downstream site
may only want a subset of the messages from the upstream
instances.</p>
<p>AMPS replication uses a leaderless, &#8220;all nodes hot&#8221; model. Any instance
in a replication fabric can accept publishes and updates at any time,
and there is no need for a message to be replicated downstream before
it is delivered to subscribers (unless a subscriber explicitly
requests otherwise using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fully_durable</span></code> option on a
bookmark replay).</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="first admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>The only communication between instances of AMPS is
through replication. AMPS instances do not share
state through the filesystem or any out-of-band
communication.</p>
<p class="last">AMPS high availability and replication do not rely
on a quorum or a controller instance. Each instance
of AMPS processes messages independently. Each
instance of AMPS manages connections and subscriptions
locally.</p>
</div>
<p>AMPS supports two forms of message acknowledgment for replication links:
<em>synchronous</em> and <em>asynchronous</em>; these settings control when AMPS considers
a message persisted. This controls when AMPS sends publishers
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">persisted</span></code> acknowledgments and the point at which AMPS considers
a message to be fully persisted for bookmark subscribers. These settings do not
affect when or how messages are replicated, or when or how messages are
delivered to subscribers unless a subscriber explicitly requests this
behavior. These settings only affect when AMPS acknowledges to the publisher
that the message has been persisted. They do not affect the speed of
replication, the priority of replication, or the guarantees that AMPS
makes for ensuring that all replicated messages are acknowledged by
the downstream instance before they can be removed from the transaction
log.</p>
<p>AMPS replication consists of a message stream (or, more precisely, a
command stream) provided to downstream instances. AMPS replicates
the messages produced as a result of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">publish</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">delta_publish</span></code>
and replicates <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sow_delete</span></code> commands. AMPS does not
replicate messages produced internally by AMPS, such as the results of
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Views</span></code> or updates sent to a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ConflatedTopic</span></code>. When replicating
queues, AMPS also uses the replication connection to send and receive
administrative commands related to queues, as described in the section
on <a class="reference internal" href="#ug-replicated-queues"><span class="std std-ref">Replicated Queues</span></a>.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>60East recommends that any server that participates in replication
<em>and</em> that accepts publishes, SOW deletes, or queue acknowledgments
directly from applications is configured with at least
one <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sync</span></code> replication destination.</p>
<p class="last">Without at least one destination that uses <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sync</span></code> acknowledgment,
an AMPS instance could be a single point of failure, resulting in
possible message loss if the instance has an unrecoverable failure
(such as a hardware failure)  between the time that
the server acknowledges a command to a client, and the time that
a replication destination receives and persists the command.</p>
</div>
<p>Notice that when replicating the results of a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">delta_publish</span></code> command, and
publishes to a topic that provides preprocessing and enrichment, AMPS
replicates the fully processed and merged message &#8211; exactly the information
that is written to the local transaction log and sent to subscribers. AMPS does
<em>not</em> save the original command to the transaction log or replicate the original
command. Instead, AMPS stores the message produced by the command and replicates that
message.</p>
<div class="section" id="replication-basics">
<h2>Replication Basics<a class="headerlink" href="#replication-basics" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>Before planning an AMPS replication topology, it can be helpful to understand
the basics of how AMPS replication works. This section presents a general
overview of the concepts that are discussed in more detail in the following
sections.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Replication is point-to-point</strong>. Each replication connection involves exactly two
AMPS instances: a source (that provides messages) and a destination that receives
messages.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Replication is always &#8220;push&#8221; replication</strong>. In AMPS, the source configures a
destination, and pushes messages to that destination. (Notice that it is possible
to configure the source to wait for the destination to connect rather than
actively making an outgoing connection, but replication is still a &#8220;push&#8221; from
the source to the destination once that connection is made). The source must be
configured to push messages to the destination, and
the source guarantees that all messages to be replicated must be acknowledged
by the destination before they can be removed from the transaction log.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Replication is one-link by default</strong>. By default, an instance of AMPS
<em>only</em> replicates messages that are published to that instance by a client.
Optionally, an instance of AMPS can be configured to replicate messages
that arrive over replication. Adding this configuration is typically
required if there are more than two instances in a replicated set
of AMPS instances. See <a class="reference internal" href="#ug-ha-passthrough"><span class="std std-ref">PassThrough Replication</span></a>
for details.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Replication relies on the transaction log</strong>. AMPS replicates the commands
as preserved in the transaction log. This means, for example, that the
results of delta publishes are replicated as fully-merged messages,
since fully-merged messages are stored in the transaction log. Likewise,
if duplicate messages arrive over different paths, only the first message
to arrive will be stored in the transaction log, and that message is
the one that will be replicated.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Replication provides a command stream</strong>. In AMPS replication, the server
replicates the results of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">publish</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">delta_publish</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sow_delete</span></code> commands
once those results are written to the transaction log. Each individual command is
replicated, for low latency and fine-grained control of what is replicated. If a
command is not in the transaction log (for example, a maintenance action has
removed the journal that contains that command, or the command is for a topic
that is not recorded in the transaction log), that command will not be replicated.</p>
<p>Replication is intended to guarantee that the command stream for a set of topics
on one instance is present on the other instance, with the ordering of each
message source preserved. This means that there can be only <em>one</em> connection
from a given upstream instance to a given downstream instance.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Replication is customizable by topic, message type, and content</strong>. AMPS can be configured to
replicate the entire transaction log, or any subset of the transaction log. This makes it
easy to use replication to populate view servers, test environments, or similar instances
that require only partial views of the source data.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Replication guarantees delivery</strong>. AMPS will not remove a journal file until
<em>all</em> messages in that journal file have been replicated to, and acknowledged by,
the destination.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Replication is composable</strong>. AMPS is capable of building a sophisticated replication
topology by composing connections. For example, full replication between two servers
is two point-to-point connections, one in each direction. The basic point-to-point
nature of connections makes it easy to reason about a single connection, and the
composable nature of AMPS replication allows you to build replication networks
that provide data distribution and high availability for applications across
data centers and around the globe.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Replication acknowledgment is configurable</strong>. The acknowledgment mode
provides different guarantees: <em>async</em> acknowledgment provides durability
guarantees for the local instance, whereas <em>sync</em> acknowledgment provides
durability guarantees for the local instance and the downstream instance.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Group</strong> identifies a set of instances that are intended to be fully
equivalent for the purposes of message contents, application failover,
and AMPS replication failover. Instances that are not intended to be
fully equivalent for all of these purposes should be given a different
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Group</span></code> name, even if they are in the same data center or geographic location,
or if they would be treated as equivalent for some, but not all, purposes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More details on each of these points is provided in this section.</p>
<div class="section" id="benefits-of-replication">
<h3>Benefits of Replication<a class="headerlink" href="#benefits-of-replication" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p id="index-1">Replication can serve two purposes in AMPS:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>It can increase the fault-tolerance of AMPS by creating a spare
instance to cut over to when the primary instance fails.</li>
<li>Replication can be used in message delivery to a remote site.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to provide fault tolerance and reliable remote site message
delivery, for the best possible messaging experience, there are some
guarantees and features that AMPS has implemented. Those features are
discussed below.</p>
<p>Replication in AMPS supports filtering by both topic and by message
content. This granularity in filtering allows replication sources to
have complete control over what messages are sent to their downstream
replication instances.</p>
<p>Additionally, replication can improve availability of AMPS by creating a
redundant instance of an AMPS server. Using replication, all of the
messages which flow into a primary instance of AMPS can be replicated to
a secondary spare instance. This way, if the primary instance should
become unresponsive for any reason, then the secondary AMPS instance can
be swapped in to begin processing message streams and requests.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="first admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p class="last">When an AMPS instance is a replication source, that instance
<em>guarantees</em> that messages will not be removed from the
transaction log until all destinations have acknowledged
the message.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configuring-replication">
<h2>Configuring Replication<a class="headerlink" href="#configuring-replication" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-2">Replication configuration involves the configuration of two or more
instances of AMPS. For testing purposes both instances of AMPS can
reside on the same physical host before deployment into a production
environment. When running both instances on one machine, the performance
characteristics will differ from production, so running both instances
on one machine is more useful for testing configuration correctness than
testing overall performance.</p>
<p>Any instance that is intended to receive messages via replication
must define an incoming replication transport as one of the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Transports</span></code> for the instance. An instance may have only one
incoming replication transport.</p>
<p>Any instance that is intended to replicate messages to another
instance must specify a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Replication</span></code> stanza in the
configuration file with at least one <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Destination</span></code>. An
instance can have multiple <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Destination</span></code> declarations: each
one defines a single outgoing replication connection.</p>
<p>In AMPS replication, instances should only be configured as part
of the same <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Group</span></code> if they are fully equivalent. That is, not
only should they contain the same messages, but they should be
considered failover alternatives for applications and other
AMPS servers. If two servers are not intended to be fully replicated
(for example, if there is one-way replication between a production
server and a test server), they should have different <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Group</span></code>
values.</p>
<div class="admonition caution">
<p class="first admonition-title">Caution</p>
<p class="last">It&#8217;s important to make sure that when running multiple AMPS
instances on the same host there are no conflicting ports.
AMPS will emit an error message and will not start properly if
it detects that a port specified in the configuration file is
already in use.</p>
</div>
<p>For the purposes of explaining this example, we&#8217;re going to assume a
simple hot-hot replication case where we have two instances of
AMPS - the first host is named <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">amps-1</span></code> and the second host is named
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">amps-2</span></code>. Each of the instances are configured to replicate data to
the other. That is, all messages published to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">amps-1</span></code> are
replicated to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">amps-2</span></code> and vice versa. This configuration ensures that
a message published to one instance is available on the other instance in
the case of a failover (although, of course, the publishers and subscribers
should also be configured for failover).</p>
<div class="admonition caution">
<p class="first admonition-title">Caution</p>
<p>Every instance of AMPS that will participate in replication
must have a unique <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Name</span></code> among <em>all</em> of the instances that
are part of replication.</p>
<p>All instances that have the same <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Group</span></code> must be able to
be treated as equivalent by AMPS replication and AMPS
clients.</p>
<p class="last">If two instances of AMPS should be treated differently
(for example, one instance receives publishes while the other
is a read-only instance that receives one-way replication),
those instances should be in different groups.</p>
</div>
<p>We will first show the relevant portion of the configuration used in
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">amps-1</span></code>, and then we will show the relevant configuration for
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">amps-2</span></code>.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="first admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p class="last">All topics to be replicated must be recorded in the transaction
log. The examples below omit the transaction log configuration

<h3>Sync vs Async Acknowledgment<a class="headerlink" href="#sync-vs-async-acknowledgment" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p id="replication-sync-vs-async">When publishing to a topic that is recorded in the transaction log, it
is recommended that publishers request a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">persisted</span></code> acknowledgment.
The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">persisted</span></code> acknowledgment message is how AMPS notifies the
publisher that a message received by AMPS is considered to be safely
persisted, as specified in the configuration. (The AMPS client
libraries automatically request this acknowledgment on each <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">publish</span></code>
command when a publish store is present for the client &#8211; that is, any
time that the client is configured to ensure that the publish is received
by the AMPS server.)</p>
<p>Depending on the replication destination configuration for the AMPS
instance that receives the message, that <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">persisted</span></code> acknowledgment
message will be delivered to the publisher at different times in the
replication process.</p>
<p>There are two options: <em>synchronous</em> or <em>asynchronous</em> acknowledgment.
These two acknowledgment <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SyncType</span></code> options control when
publishers of messages are sent <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">persisted</span></code> acknowledgments.</p>
<p>For <em>synchronous</em> replication acknowledgments, AMPS will not return a
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">persisted</span></code> acknowledgment to the publisher for a message until the
message has been stored to the local transaction log, to the SOW, and
all downstream synchronous replication destinations have acknowledged
the message. The figure below shows the cycle of a message being
published in a replicated instance, and the persisted acknowledgment
message being returned back to the publisher. Notice that, with this
configuration, the publisher will not receive an acknowledgment if the
remote destination is unavailable. 60East recommends that when you use
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sync</span></code> replication, you consider setting a policy for downgrading the
link when a destination is offline, as described in
<a class="reference internal" href="#ug-replication-downgrade"><span class="std std-ref">Downgrading Acknowledgments for a Destination</span></a>.</p>

<img alt="Synchronous acknowledgment -- no acknowledgment to publisher until the downstream instance acknowledges" src="../_images/HA_sync_ack.png" />
</div>
<p><em>Sequence for a Connection Using Sync Acknowledgment</em></p>
<p>For destinations configured with <em>async</em> replication acknowledgment,
an AMPS instance does not require that the destination acknowledge that the
message is persisted before acknowledging the message to the publisher.
That is, for <em>async</em> acknowledgment, the AMPS instance replicating
the message sends the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">persisted</span></code> acknowledgment message back
to the publisher as soon as the message is stored in the local transaction
log and SOW stores.</p>
<p>The acknowledgment type (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SyncType</span></code>) has no effect on how an instance of
AMPS replicates the message to other instances of AMPS. The acknowledgment
type <em>only</em> affects whether an instance of AMPS must receive an acknowledgment
from that <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Destination</span></code> before it will acknowledge a message as having
been persisted.</p>
<p>The figure below shows the cycle of a message being published with a
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SyncType</span></code> configuration set to <em>async</em> acknowledgment.</p>

<p><em>Sequence for a Connection Using Async Acknowledgment</em></p>
<p>By default, replication destinations do not affect when a message is delivered
to a subscription. Optionally, a subscriber can request the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fully_durable</span></code>
option on a bookmark subscription (that is, a replay from the transaction log).
When the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fully_durable</span></code> option is specified, AMPS does not deliver a message
to that subscriber until all replication destinations configured for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sync</span></code>
acknowledgment have acknowledged the message.</p>
<div class="admonition caution">
<p class="first admonition-title">Caution</p>
<p class="last">Every instance of AMPS that accepts publish commands, SOW delete commands

instances should specify <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sync</span></code> acknowledgment between them to
prevent a situation where a message could be lost if an instance fails

<span id="ug-replication-downgrade"></span><h3>Downgrading Acknowledgments for a Destination<a class="headerlink" href="#downgrading-acknowledgments-for-a-destination" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>The AMPS administrative console provides the ability to downgrade a
replication link from <em>synchronous</em> to <em>asynchronous</em> acknowledgment.
This feature is useful to relieve memory or storage pressure on publishers
should a downstream AMPS instance prove unstable, unresponsive, or be
experiencing excessive latency to the point that it should be
considered to be offline.</p>
<p>Downgrading a replication link to <em>asynchronous</em> means that any
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">persisted</span></code> acknowledgment message that a publisher may be waiting on
will no longer wait for the downstream instance to confirm that it has
committed the message to its downstream Transaction Log or SOW store.
AMPS immediately considers the downstream instance to have acknowledged
the message for existing messages, which means that if AMPS was waiting
for acknowledgment from that instance to deliver a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">persisted</span></code>
acknowledgment, AMPS immediately sends the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">persisted</span></code>
acknowledgment when the instance is downgraded.</p>
<p>The result of a link being downgraded is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The number of messages that the publisher must retain is reduced, <em>but</em></li>
<li>The downgraded link is unsafe for the publisher to fail over to</li>
<li>The downgraded link is unsafe for a bookmark subscriber to fail over to</li>
</ul>
<p>Automatic downgrade is most suitable for a situation where an instance
should be considered offline or unavailable.</p>
<div class="admonition caution">
<p class="first admonition-title">Caution</p>
<p>Downgrading a destination means that this instance will not
wait for that destination to acknowledge a message
before acknowledging that message to publishers or
upstream instances. It does not affect any other
behavior of the instance.</p>
<p>A publisher or queue consumer must not fail over
from this instance to a destination that has been
downgraded to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">async</span></code> acknowledgment. This can
cause message loss, since the upstream instance may
have acknowledged a message that the downstream
instance has not yet processed.</p>
<p class="last">A bookmark subscriber must not fail over from
this instance to a destination that has been

</div>
<p>AMPS can be configured to automatically downgrade a replication link to
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">asynchronous</span></code> if the remote side of the link cannot keep up with
persisting messages or becomes unresponsive. This option prevents
unreliable links from holding up publishers, but increases the chances
of a single instance failure resulting in message loss, as described
above. AMPS can also be configured to automatically upgrade a
replication link that has previously been downgraded. If an instance
is configured to downgrade acknowledgment, it should also
be configured to upgrade acknowledgment.</p>
<p>Automatic downgrade is implemented as an AMPS action. To configure
automatic downgrade, add the appropriate action to the configuration

<div class="section" id="replication-configuration-validation">
<h2>Replication Configuration Validation<a class="headerlink" href="#replication-configuration-validation" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>Replication configuration validation helps to ensure that
any configuration that could result in message loss or inconsistent
message contents between two instances of AMPS is explicitly
designed into the replication topology and not the result
of accidental misconfiguration.</p>
<p>Replication can involve coordinating configuration among a large number
of AMPS instances. It can sometimes be difficult to ensure that all
of the instances are configured correctly, and to ensure that a
configuration change for one instance is also made at the replication
destinations. For example, if a high-availability pair replicates the
topics ORDERS, INVENTORY, and CUSTOMERS to a remote disaster recovery
site, but the disaster recovery site only replicates ORDERS and
INVENTORY back to the high-availability pair, disaster recovery may not
occur as planned. Likewise, if only one member of the HA pair replicates
ORDERS to the other member of the pair, the two instances will contain
different messages, which could cause problems for the system.</p>
<p>Starting in the 5.0 release, AMPS automatic replication configuration
validation makes it easier to keep configuration items consistent across
a replication fabric.</p>
<p>Replication configuration validation happens when a replication
connection is made between two instances. The validation compares
the configuration of those two instances. By default, any difference
in configuration that could result in message loss, different
behavior between the source instance and the destination instance,
or different replication guarantees between the source instance
and the destination instance is reported as an error.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p class="last">When replication validation reports an error, the reason for the
error is logged to the event log on the instance that detects
the problem, and the connection is closed.</p>
</div>
<p>Automatic configuration validation is enabled for all elements of the
replication configuration by default. You can turn off validation for
specific elements of the configuration, as described below.</p>
<p>AMPS replication uses a leaderless, &#8220;all nodes hot&#8221; model. This means
that no single AMPS instance has a view of the entire replication
fabric, and a single AMPS instance will always assume that there are
instances in the replication fabric that it is not aware of. The
replication validation rules are designed with this assumption. The
advantage of this assumption is that if instances are added to the
replication fabric, it is typically only necessary to change
configuration on the instances that they directly communicate with
for replication to function as expected. The tradeoff, however, is
that it is sometimes necessary to configure an instance as though
it were part of a larger fabric (or exclude a validation rule)
even in a case where the instance is part of a much simpler
replication design.</p>
<p>Each <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Topic</span></code> in a replication <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Destination</span></code> can configure a unique
set of validation checks. By default, all of the checks apply to all
topics in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Destination</span></code>.</p>
<p>When troubleshooting a configuration validation error, it is important
to look at the AMPS logs on <em>both</em> sides of the connection. Typically, the
AMPS instance that detects the error will log complete information on the
part of validation that failed and the changes required for the connection
to succeed, while the other side of the connection will simply note that the
connection failed validation. This means that if a validation error is reported
on one instance, but details are not present, the other side of the connection
detected the error and will have logged relevant details.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">Excluding a validation check directs AMPS to make a
replication connection that could result in inconsistent
state or data loss. Use caution when excluding
validation checks. See the table below for
details on each validation check.</p>
</div>
<p>The table below lists aspects of replication that AMPS validates. By default, replication
validation treats the downstream instance as though it is intended to be a full
highly-available failover partner for any topic that is replicated. For situations
where that is not the case, many validation rules can be excluded. For example, if
the downstream instance is a view server that does not accept publishes and,
therefore, is not configured to replicate a particular topic back to this instance,
the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">replicate</span></code> validation check might need to be excluded.</p>

<h2>Replication Resynchronization<a class="headerlink" href="#replication-resynchronization" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>When a replication connection is established between AMPS
instances, the upstream instance publishes any messages that it
contains in its transaction log that the downstream instance
may not have previously received. This process is called
&#8220;replication resync&#8221;. During resync, the upstream instance
replays from the transaction log, replicating messages that
match the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Topic</span></code> (and, optionally, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Filter</span></code>) specification(s)
for the downstream <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Destination</span></code>.</p>
<p>When a replication connection is established between AMPS servers
that are both version 5.3.3.0 or higher, the servers exchange
information about the messages present in the transaction log to
determine the earliest message in the transaction log on the
upstream instance that is not present on the downstream instance.
Replication resynchronization will begin at that point. This
approach to finding the resynchronization point applies
whether or not these two instances have had a replication
connection before.</p>
<p>For replication between older versions of AMPS, replication
resynchronization begins at the last point in the upstream
instance&#8217;s transaction log that the downstream instance has
received. For those versions of AMPS, messages from other
instances are not considered when determining the
resynchronization point.</p>

<div class="section" id="replication-compression">
<span id="index-3"></span><h2>Replication Compression<a class="headerlink" href="#replication-compression" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>AMPS provides the ability to compress the replication connection. In
typical use, using replication compression can greatly reduce the
bandwidth required between AMPS instances.</p>
<p>The precise amount of compression that AMPS can achieve depends on the
content of the replicated messages. Compression is configured at the
replication source, and does not need to be enabled in the transport
configuration at the instance receiving the replicated messages.</p>
<p>For AMPS instances that are receiving replicated messages, no additional
configuration is necessary. AMPS automatically recognizes when an
incoming replication connection uses compression.</p>
<p>See the <em>AMPS Configuration Guide</em> for enabling compression and choosing
a compression algorithm.</p>

<div class="section" id="destination-server-failover">
<h2>Destination Server Failover<a class="headerlink" href="#destination-server-failover" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>Your replication plan may include replication to a server that is part
of a highly-available group.</p>
<p>There are two common approaches to destination server failover:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Wide IP</strong> - AMPS replication works transparently with wide IP and
many installations use wide IP for destination server failover. The
advantage of this approach is that it requires no additional
configuration in AMPS and redundant servers can be added or removed
from the wide IP group without reconfiguring the instances that
replicate to the group. A disadvantage to this approach is that failover
can require several seconds and messages are not replicated during the
time that it takes for failover to occur.</li>
<li><strong>AMPS Failover</strong> - AMPS allows you to specify multiple downstream
servers in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">InetAddr</span></code> element of a destination. In this case, AMPS
treats the defined list of servers as a list of equivalent servers, listed
in order of priority.</li>
</ol>
<p>When multiple addresses are specified for a destination, each time AMPS
needs to make a connection to a destination and there is no incoming
connection from a server in that destination, AMPS starts at the
beginning of the list and attempts to connect to each address in the
list. If AMPS is unable to connect to any address in the list, AMPS
waits for a timeout period, then begins again with the first server on
the list. Each time AMPS reaches the end of the list without
establishing a connection, AMPS increases the timeout period. If an incoming
connection from one of the servers on the list exists, AMPS will use that
connection for outgoing replication. If multiple incoming connections
from servers in the list exist, AMPS will choose one of the incoming
connections to use for outgoing traffic.</p>
<p>This capability allows you to easily set up replication to a
highly-available group. If the server you are replicating to fails over,
AMPS uses the prioritized list of servers to re-establish a connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="two-way-replication">
<h2>Two-Way Replication<a class="headerlink" href="#two-way-replication" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>Two-way replication, sometimes called <em>Back Replication</em>, is a term used
to describe a replication scenario where there are two instances of AMPS
&#8211; termed <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">AMPS-A</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">AMPS-B</span></code> for this example.</p>
<p>In a two-way replication configuration, messages that are published to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">AMPS-A</span></code>
are replicated to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">AMPS-B</span></code>. Likewise, messages which are published to
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">AMPS-B</span></code> are replicated to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">AMPS-A</span></code>. This replication scheme is used
when both instances of AMPS need to be in sync with each other to handle
a failover scenario with no loss of messages between them. This way, if
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">AMPS-A</span></code> should fail at any point, applications can immediately fail over
to the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">AMPS-B</span></code> instance, allowing message flow to resume with as little
downtime as possible.</p>
<p>To enable two-way replication, each instance of AMPS defines
a replication <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Transport</span></code> to receive incoming replication
messages. Each instance also defines a replication <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Destination</span></code>
to deliver messages to the other instance.</p>
<p>Notice that servers are intended to function as failover partners.
Since a publisher may fail over between these two instances, the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Destination</span></code> on each instance that replicates to the other instance
is configured to use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sync</span></code> message acknowledgment. This
ensures that a publisher does not consider a message to be persisted
until all of the failover partners have received and persisted the
message.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">When configuring a set of instances for failover, it is important that
the instances use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sync</span></code> message acknowledgment among the set of
instances that a given client will consider for failover. It should never be
possible for a publisher to fail over from one instance to another instance
if the replication link between those instances is configured for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">async</span></code>
acknowledgments.</p>
</div>
<p id="index-4">Starting with the 5.0 release, when AMPS detects back replication
between a pair of instances, AMPS will prefer using a single network
connection between the servers, replicating messages in both directions
(that is, to both destinations) over a single connection.  This can
be particularly useful for situations where you need to have messages
replicated, but only one server can initiate a connection. For example,
when one of the servers is in a DMZ, and cannot make a connection to a
server within the company. AMPS also allows you to specify a replication
destination with no InetAddr provided. In this case, the instance will
replicate once the destination establishes a connection, but will not initiate
a connection. When both instances specify an InetAddr, AMPS may temporarily
create two connections between the instances while replication is being established.
In this case, after detecting that there are two connections active, AMPS will
close one of the network connections and allow both AMPS instances to use
the remaining network connection to publish messages to the other instance.
Notice that using a single network connection is simply an optimization to
more efficiently use the available sockets. This does not change the way
messages are replicated or the replication protocol, nor does it change the
requirement that all messages in a journal are replicated to all destinations
before a journal can be removed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="passthrough-replication">
<span id="ug-ha-passthrough"></span><h2>PassThrough Replication<a class="headerlink" href="#passthrough-replication" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>PassThrough Replication is a term used to describe the ability of an
AMPS instance to pass along replicated messages to another AMPS
instance. This allows you to easily keep multiple failover or DR
destinations in sync from a single AMPS instance. Unless passthrough
replication is configured, an AMPS instance only replicates messages
directly published to that instance from an application. By default,
an instance <em>does not</em> re-replicate messages received over replication.</p>
<p>PassThrough replication uses the name of the originating AMPS group to
indicate that messages that arrive at this instance of AMPS directly
from that group are to be replicated to the specified destination.
PassThrough replication supports regular expressions to specify groups,
and allows multiple server groups per destination. Notice that if the
destination instance does not specify a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Group</span></code> in its instance config,
the group name is the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Name</span></code> of the instance.</p>
<p>To ensure that an instance replicates a full copy of its transaction
log downstream (which is typically the intended result), include
a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PassThrough</span></code> configuration item that matches any group name.</p>
<p>With care, some topologies can use a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PassThrough</span></code> configuration
that only replicates messages directly published to the instance
and a subset of messages received over replication.
This can result in significant bandwidth reduction in some
topologies, but must be configured with care to ensure that
messages do not fail to reach all of the instances, since
in this case AMPS is configured to replicate only a <em>part</em> of
the transaction log of the local instance.</p>

<p>When a message is eligible for passthrough replication, topic and

<p>AMPS protects against loops in passthrough replication by tracking the
instance names or group names that a message has passed through. AMPS
does not allow a message to travel through the same instance and group name
more than once.</p>

<p>If an instance replicates a queue (distributed queue) or a group local queue, it
<em>must also</em> provide passthrough for any incoming replication group that replicates that
topic (even if the incoming replication connection is from the same group that this
instance belongs to). The reason for this is simple: AMPS must ensure that messages
for a replicated queue, including acknowledgments and transfer messages, are able
to reach every instance that hosts the queue if possible, even if a network connection
fails or an instance goes offline. Therefore, this instance must pass through messages
received from other instances that affect the queue.</p>

<div class="section" id="guarantees-on-ordering">
<h2>Guarantees on Ordering<a class="headerlink" href="#guarantees-on-ordering" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>For each publisher, on a single topic, AMPS is guaranteed to deliver
messages to subscribers in the same order that the messages were
published by the original publisher. This guarantee holds true
regardless of how many publishers or how many subscribers are connected
to AMPS at any one time.</p>
<p>For each instance, AMPS is guaranteed to deliver messages in the order
in which the messages were received by the instance, regardless of
whether a message is received directly from a publisher or indirectly
via replication. The message order for the instance is recorded in the
transaction log, and is guaranteed to remain consistent across server
restarts.</p>
<p>These guarantees mean that subscribers will not spend unnecessary CPU
cycles checking timestamps or other message content to verify which
message is the most recent, or reordering messages during playback. This
frees up subscriber resources to do more important work.</p>
<p>AMPS preserves an absolute order across topics for a single subscription
for all topics <em>except</em> views, queues, and conflated topics.
Applications often rely on this behavior to correlate the times at which
messages to different topics were processed by AMPS. See

<h2>Understanding Replication Message Routing<a class="headerlink" href="#understanding-replication-message-routing" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>An instance of AMPS will replicate a message to a given <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Destination</span></code> when
all of the following conditions are met (and there is an active replication
connection to the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Destination</span></code>):</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The message must be recorded in the transaction log for this instance (that is,
the topic that the message is published to must be recorded in the transaction
log with the appropriate message type).</li>
<li>The AMPS instance must be configured to replicate messages with that
topic and message type to the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Destination</span></code>. (If a content filter
is included in the replication configuration, the message must
also match the content filter.)</li>
<li>The message must <em>either</em> have been directly published to this instance, or
if the message was received via replication, the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Destination</span></code> must specify
a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PassThrough</span></code> rule that matches the AMPS instance that this instance
received the message from.</li>
<li>The message must not have previously passed through the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Destination</span></code>
being replicated to; replication loops are not permitted.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each instance that receives a message evaluates the conditions above for each
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Destination</span></code>. The same process is followed when replaying messages from
the transaction log while resynchronizing the downstream replication
destination.</p>
<p>To verify that a given set of configurations replicates the appropriate
messages, start at each instance that will receive publishes and trace the
possible replication paths, applying these rules. If, at any time, applying
these rules creates a situation where a message does not reach an instance
of AMPS that is intended to receive the message, revise the rules (typically,
by adjusting the topics replicated to a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Destination</span></code> or the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PassThrough</span></code> configuration for a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Destination</span></code>) until
messages reach the intended instances regardless of route.</p>

<h2>Maximum Downstream Destinations<a class="headerlink" href="#maximum-downstream-destinations" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>

<span id="ug-replicated-queues"></span><span id="index-5"></span><h2>Replicated Queues<a class="headerlink" href="#replicated-queues" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>AMPS provides a unique approach to replicating queues. This approach is
designed to offer high performance in the most common cases, while
continuing to provide delivery model guarantees, resilience and failover
in the event that one of the replicated instances goes offline.</p>
<p>When a queue is replicated, AMPS replicates the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">publish</span></code> commands to
the underlying topic, the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sow_delete</span></code> commands that contain the
acknowledgment messages, and special queue management commands that are
internal to AMPS.</p>
<div class="section" id="queue-message-ownership">
<span id="ug-queue-message-ownership"></span><h3>Queue Message Ownership<a class="headerlink" href="#queue-message-ownership" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>To guarantee that no message is processed more than once, AMPS tracks
ownership of the message within the network of replicated instances.</p>
<p>For a distributed queue (that is, a queue defined with the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Queue</span></code>
configuration element), the instance that first receives the publish
command from a client owns the message. Although all replicated instances
downstream record the publish command in their transaction
logs, they do not provide the message to queue subscribers unless that
instance owns the message.</p>
<p>For a group local queue (that is, a queue defined with the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GroupLocalQueue</span></code>
tag), the instance specified in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">InitialOwner</span></code> element for the queue
owns a message when the message first enters the queue, regardless of where
the message was originally published.</p>
<p>Only one instance can own a message at any given time. Other instances
can request that the current owner transfer ownership of a message.</p>
<p>To transfer ownership, an instance that does not currently own the message
makes a request to the current message owner. The owning instance makes an
explicit decision to transfer ownership, and replicates the transfer
notification to all instances to which the queue topic is replicated.</p>
<p>The instance that owns a message will always deliver the message to a
local subscriber if possible. This means that performance for local
subscribers is unaffected by the number of downstream instances.
However, this also means that if the local subscribers are keeping up
with the message volume being published to the queue, the owning
instance will never need to grant a transfer of ownership.</p>
<p>A downstream instance will request ownership transfer if:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The downstream instance has subscriptions for that topic with
available backlog, <em>and</em></li>
<li>The amount of time since the message arrived at the instance is
greater than the typical time between the replicated message arriving
and the replicated acknowledgment arriving.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that this approach is intended to minimize ungranted transfer
requests. In normal circumstances, the typical processing time reflects
the speed at which the local processors are consuming messages at a
steady state. Downstream instances will only request messages that have
been seen to exceed that time, indicating that the processors are not
keeping up with the incoming message rate.</p>
<p>The instance that owns the message will grant ownership to a requesting
instance if:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The request is the first request received for this message, <em>and</em></li>
<li>There are no subscribers on the owning instance that can accept the
message</li>
</ol>
<p>When the owning instance grants the request, it logs the transfer in its
transaction log and sends the transfer of ownership to all instances
that are receiving replicated messages for the queue. When the owning
instance does not grant the transfer of ownership, it takes no action.</p>
<p>Notice that your replication topology must be able to replicate
acknowledgments to all instances that receive messages for the queue.
Otherwise, an instance that does not receive the acknowledgments will
not consider the messages to be processed. Replication validation can
help to identify topologies that do not meet this requirement.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="first admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p class="last">A <em>barrier message</em> is delivered immediately when
there are no unacknowledged messages ahead of the
barrier message in the queue on this instance,
<em>regardless of which instance owns the message</em>. This
means that for a distributed queue or group local queue,
every queue that contains the barrier message will deliver
the barrier message when all previous messages on that
instance have been acknowledged.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="failover-and-queue-message-ownership">
<h4>Failover and Queue Message Ownership<a class="headerlink" href="#failover-and-queue-message-ownership" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>When an instance that contains a queue fails or is shut down, that
instance is no longer able to grant ownership requests for the messages
that it owns. By default, those messages become unavailable for
delivery, since there is no longer a central coordination point at which
to ensure that the messages are only delivered once.</p>
<p>AMPS provides a way to make those messages available. Through the admin
console, you can choose to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">enable_proxied_transfer</span></code>, which allows an
instance to act as an ownership proxy for an instance that has gone
offline. In this mode, the local instance can assume ownership of
messages that are owned by an offline instance.</p>
<p><em>Use this setting with care</em>: when active, it is possible for messages to
be delivered twice if the instance that had previously owned the message
comes back online, or if multiple instances have proxied transfer
enabled for the same queue.</p>
<p>In general, you <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">enable_proxied_transfer</span></code> as a temporary recovery step
while one of the instances is offline, and then disable proxied transfer
when the instance comes back online, or when all of the messages owned
by that instance have been processed.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="configuration-for-queue-replication">
<h3>Configuration for Queue Replication<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration-for-queue-replication" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>To provide replication for a distributed queue, AMPS requires that the
replication configuration meet the following requirements:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Provide bidirectional replication between the instances. In other
words, if instance A replicates a queue to instance B, instance B
must also replicate that queue to instance A.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If the topic is a queue on one instance, it must be a queue on all
replicated instances.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">On all replicated instances, the queue must use the same underlying
topic definition and filters. For queues that use a regular
expression as the topic definition, this means that the regular
expression must be the same. For a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GroupLocalQueue</span></code>, the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">InitialOwner</span></code> must be the same on all instances that contain
the queue.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The underlying topics must be replicated to all replicated instances
(since this is where the messages for the queue are stored).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Replicated instances must provide passthrough for instances that
replicate queues. For example, consider the following replication
topology: Instance A in group One replicates a queue to instance B in
group Two. Instance B in group Two replicates the queue to instance C
in group Three.</p>
<p>For this configuration, instance B must provide passthrough for group
Three to instance A, and must also provide passthrough for group One
to instance C. The reason for this is to ensure that ownership
transfer and acknowledgment messages can reach all instances that
maintain a copy of the queue.</p>
<p>Likewise, consider a topology where Instance X in GroupOne replicates
a queue to Instance Y in GroupOne. Instance X must provide passthrough
for GroupOne, since any incoming replication messages for the queue
(for example, from Instance Z) that arrive at Instance X must be
<em>guaranteed</em> to reach Instance Y. Otherwise, it would be possible for the
queue on Instance Y to have different messages than Instance X and Instance
Z if Instance Z does not replicate to Instance Y (or if the network
connection between Instance Z and Instance Y fails).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that <em>the requirements above apply only to queue topics</em>. If the
underlying topic uses a different name than the queue topic, it is
possible to replicate the messages from the underlying topic <em>without</em>
replicating the queue itself. This approach can be convenient for simply
recording and storing the messages provided to the queue on an archival
or auditing instance. When only the underlying topic (or topics) are
replicated, the requirements above do not apply, since AMPS does not
provide queuing behavior for the underlying topics.</p>
<p>A queue defined with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">LocalQueue</span></code> cannot be replicated. The data from
the underlying topics for the queue can be replicated without special
restrictions. The queue topic itself, however, cannot be replicated.
AMPS reports an error if any <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">LocalQueue</span></code> topic is replicated.</p>

<span id="bootstrap-initialization"></span><h2>Bootstrap Initialization of AMPS Replication<a class="headerlink" href="#bootstrap-initialization-of-amps-replication" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-6">AMPS offers the ability to initialize replication by recovering
the full current set of messages in an AMPS instance from another
instance.</p>
<p>Bootstrap initialization can restore the messages in the
transaction log of the source instance. Unlike replication,
bootstrap initialization will restore messages that
would not normally be replicated, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The full current contents of SOW topics (including messages that
are present in the SOW, but are no longer in the transaction log).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Messages that would not be replicated to the
instance being bootstrapped due to protection against
replication loops.</p>
<p>That is, if the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">AMPS-Instance-A</span></code> instance is being
recovered, bootstrap recovery will copy messages
that were originally published to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">AMPS-Instance-A</span></code>.</p>
<p>Replication does not return messages to the instance
that the message was originally received from (to
prevent loops, and because that instance is already
known to have the message).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bootstrap replication initialization uses the
AMPS replication transport to retrieve messages from
the source. However, the bootstrap initialization
process itself is distinct from replication and
happens as a part of AMPS recovery, <em>before</em> replication
begins.</p>
<div class="admonition caution">
<p class="first admonition-title">Caution</p>
<p>Since an instance must finish bootstrap
initialization before providing any other
service, two instances of AMPS should not
try to bootstrap from each other in a
situation where both transaction logs
are empty. In this case, both instances
will wait for the other instance, and neither
instance will recover.</p>
<p class="last">If two instances of AMPS will be recovery

<p>Bootstrap initialization only takes place when

<h3>When to Use Bootstrap Initialization<a class="headerlink" href="#when-to-use-bootstrap-initialization" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>Bootstrap initialization is most commonly used
for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Disaster Recovery</strong> - In a situation where the
entire state of the instance has been lost,
bootstrap replication initialization can effectively
recover the state of the instance, including the
SOW topics and messages originally published to
the instance.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Scale-out Scenarios</strong> - When an instance of AMPS
joins an existing set of instances that maintain
data in SOW topics for longer than the instances
maintain the transaction log.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Offline Replica Scenarios</strong> - For example, bootstrap
initialization might be a good option for periodically
repopulating a development or reporting environment
that periodically needs a full copy of the data in
an instance, but does not require active message flow.</p>
<p>In this case, the state for the instance is typically
removed on a regular basis. The message contents
are recovered using bootstrap initialization, but the
upstream instance may not continue to replicate messages
while the instance is running, since active message flow
is not necessary.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="starting-bootstrap-initialization">
<h3>Starting Bootstrap Initialization<a class="headerlink" href="#starting-bootstrap-initialization" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>An instance of AMPS will begin bootstrap initialization
when:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The instance is configured to bootstrap the initial state.</li>
<li>The AMPS instance does not detect persistent state
when it starts (or AMPS detects that it was
shut down while bootstrap was underway).</li>
</ul>
<p>An AMPS instance will <strong>only</strong> use bootstrap initialization when
that instance starts with no messages in the transaction log.
Bootstrap initialization will not overwrite or modify existing
messages on an instance. If there are messages in the transaction
log for the AMPS instance, the instance will not perform
bootstrap initialization.</p>
<p>An AMPS instance does not
use bootstrap initialization once the instance starts. To keep
message state consistent between two instances of AMPS while
AMPS is running, use AMPS replication.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configuring-bootstrap-initialization">
<h3>Configuring Bootstrap Initialization<a class="headerlink" href="#configuring-bootstrap-initialization" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>To configure bootstrap initialization, the configuration on the
instance being initialized must include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A replication transport (that is, a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Transport</span></code> of type <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">amps-replication</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">amps-replication-secure</span></code></li>
<li>A transaction log, <em>and</em></li>
<li>A bootstrap directive</li>
</ul>
<p>Most often, the instance that is the source of bootstrap
messages will also replicate to the instance that is being
initialized. However, this is not required: the instance being
bootstrapped can receive replication publishes from a
completely different instance or set of instances.</p>
<p>The instance that will serve as the source of bootstrap
initialization must define a replication transport, and
must also have recorded the information that will be
used for initialization (that is, the topics that will
be initialized must be in the transaction log and/or
SOW).</p>
<p>For example, the following configuration will initialize
the message state of the instance from the source AMPS
instance located at <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">source.example.com</span></code> or, if that
server is unavailable, at the AMPS instance located at
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">backup.example.com</span></code>. In both cases, those instances
must have configured a replication transport listening
on port <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">4100</span></code>.</p>
<p>This instance will initialize the topics <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">important-topic</span></code>
and any topic that begins with the string <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">audit-topic</span></code>
of message type <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">json</span></code> from the source server. If either
of these topics is recorded in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SOW</span></code>, the current
messages from the source instance will be copied to this
instance of AMPS.</p>

<div class="section" id="replication-best-practices">
<span id="common-replication-best-practices"></span><span id="index-7"></span><h2>Replication Best Practices<a class="headerlink" href="#replication-best-practices" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>For your application to work properly in an environment that uses
AMPS replication, it is important to follow these best practices:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Every client that changes the state of AMPS must have a distinct client
name</em> - Although AMPS only enforces this requirement for an individual
instance, if two clients with the same name are connected to two
different instances, and both clients publish messages, delete messages,
or acknowledge messages from a queue, the messages present on each
instance of AMPS can become inconsistent.</li>
<li><em>Use replication filters with caution, especially for queue topics</em> - Using
a replication filter will create different topic contents on each instance.
In addition, using a replication filter for a message queue topic (or the
underlying topic for a message queue) can create different queue contents
on different instances, and messages that are not replicated must be
consumed from the instance where they were originally published.</li>
<li><em>Do not manually set client sequence numbers on published messages</em> -
The publish store classes in the AMPS client libraries manage sequence
numbers for published messages to ensure that there is no message
loss or duplication in a high availability environment. 60East
recommends using those publish stores to manage sequence numbers
rather than setting them manually. Since AMPS uses the sequence
number to identify duplicate messages, setting sequence numbers
manually can cause AMPS to discard messages or lead to inconsistent
state across instances.</li>
<li><em>Default to PassThrough for every group</em> - PassThrough for every
group guarantees that each upstream instance will provide the
full set of messages that it has to downstream groups. For some
topologies, it is possible to reduce traffic to downstream
instances by using the PassThrough configuration to avoid replicating
messages that are guaranteed to arrive via another route (even in
cases of network or server failure), but this should be done
with caution.</li>
<li><em>Do not allow a publisher or queue consumer to fail over between
two instances that are replicating using async acknowledgment</em> - The
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">async</span></code> acknowledgment mode means that messages are acknowledged
to a publisher before the downstream replication instance has
acknowledged that it has received the message. Allowing a publisher
to fail over between two instances that are using <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">async</span></code> acknowledgment
runs the risk of creating inconsistent state or message loss.</li>
</ul>
