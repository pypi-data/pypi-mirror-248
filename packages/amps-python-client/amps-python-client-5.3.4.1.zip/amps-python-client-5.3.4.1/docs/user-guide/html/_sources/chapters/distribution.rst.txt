AMPS Distribution Layout
=============================

This appendix lists the layout of the AMPS distribution, with special focus
on the binaries present in the layout. Use this appendix to plan your
AMPS deployment.

60East recommends that all AMPS deployments contain the full contents of
the ``/bin`` and ``/lib`` directories. For development installations
that are extending the AMPS server, your installation should contain the
``/api`` and ``/sdk`` directories (as well as the *AMPS Server SDK*,
available through 60East support).

The AMPS distribution contains the following items at the top level:

.. list-table:: *AMPS distribution contents*
     :header-rows: 1

     * - Item

       - Description

     * - ``/bin``
         

       - AMPS binaries: the AMPS server,

     * - ``/docs``
         

       - AMPS base documentation. Current
         versions of the documentation and
         additional guides are available from
