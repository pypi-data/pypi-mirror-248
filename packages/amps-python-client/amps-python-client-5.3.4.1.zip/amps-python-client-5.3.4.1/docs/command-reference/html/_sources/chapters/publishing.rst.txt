Publishing to AMPS
======================

This section describes commands used
to send data to AMPS.

Notice that, for topics in the state of
the world, AMPS treats these commands
as inserting a new message if one
does not already exist, and updating
the existing message if a message already
exists.

For topics in the transaction log,
each ``publish`` or ``delta_publish`` will
store the current message in the
transaction log, just as it
would be delivered to subscribers.
