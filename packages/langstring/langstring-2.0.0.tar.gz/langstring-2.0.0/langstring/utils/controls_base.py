"""Define the foundational structure for managing configuration flags in LangString and MultiLangString classes.

Overview:
---------
The module introduces a metaclass, `NonInstantiable`, to prevent instantiation of certain classes, and a base class,
`ControlBase`, which serves as a template for managing configuration flags in LangString and MultiLangString classes.
These flags are crucial for controlling various behaviors and features of LangString and MultiLangString instances,
enabling flexible and dynamic configuration.

Classes:
- NonInstantiable: A metaclass used to create classes that are intended to serve as static utility containers or
  namespaces, rather than as entities for instantiation. This is particularly useful for defining classes that
  encapsulate static methods and class variables.

- ControlBase: An abstract base class designed to be the foundation for LangStringControl and MultiLangStringControl.
  It provides abstract and concrete class methods for managing configuration flags, ensuring consistent and global
  configuration across LangString and MultiLangString instances. As a non-instantiable class, it underscores its role
  as a static manager rather than an object-oriented entity.

Key Features:
- Unified Flag Management: Offers a centralized approach to control configuration flags for both LangString and
  MultiLangString, ensuring uniformity and consistency in behavior.
- Extensibility and Flexibility: The abstract method `_get_flags_type` in `ControlBase` allows subclasses to define
  their own flag enumeration types, catering to specific configuration needs.
- Debugging and Monitoring Tools: Methods like `print_flags` and `get_flags` in `ControlBase` provide essential tools
  for debugging and monitoring the current state of configuration flags, aiding in development and troubleshooting.

Usage:
This module is integral to systems where LangString and MultiLangString classes are used, requiring dynamic
configuration and behavior modification. It is particularly beneficial in environments where global settings for
these classes need to be programmatically adjusted or inspected.

Note:
The module is structured with the expectation that it will be extended by concrete implementations for LangString and
MultiLangString classes, which will define their specific sets of flags and associated behaviors.

Example:
    # Setting a flag in LangStringControl
    LangStringControl.set_flag(LangStringFlag.ENSURE_TEXT, True)

    # Resetting all flags to default in MultiLangStringControl
    MultiLangStringControl.reset_flags()
