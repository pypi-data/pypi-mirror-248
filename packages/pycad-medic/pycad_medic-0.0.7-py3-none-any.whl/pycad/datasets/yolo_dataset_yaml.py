class YOLODatasetYaml:
    '''
    This class creates the `dataset.yaml` file to train the YOLOv8 model.\n
    `Params`:
    - train_path: the path to training images and labels (you give just the directory that contains the two folders)
    - valid_path: the path to valid images and labels (you give just the directory that contains the two folders)
    - nc: the number of classes to train
    - class_names: here you can enter as much as class names as you want to train, the number of class names should be equal to the number of classes given before\n

    To create the dataset.yaml file, you need to call the method `create_yaml` and also give the path to the location to save the yaml file.\n
    \n\n
    #### Example usage:
    from pycad.datasets import YOLODatasetYaml

    config = YOLODatasetYaml("path/to/train", "path/to/valid", 3, "t1", "t2", "t3")\n
    config.create_yaml("dataset.yaml")
