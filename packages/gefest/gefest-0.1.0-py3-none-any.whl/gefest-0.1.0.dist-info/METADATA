**GEFEST** (**G**\enerative **E**\volution **F**\or **E**\ncoded **ST**\ructures) is a toolbox for the generative design of
physical objects.

In core it uses:
1. Numerical modelling to simulate the interaction between object and environment
2. Evolutionary optimization to produce new variants of geometrically-encoded structures

The basic abstractions in GEFEST are Point, Polygon, Structure and Domain. Architecture of the GEFEST can be described as:

   :align: center


The evolutionary workflow of the generative design is the following:

   :align: center

The dynamics of the optimisation can be visualized as (breakwaters optimisation case):

How to use
==========

All details about first steps with GEFEST might be found in the `quick start guide <https://gefest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gefest/quickstart.html>`__.

Tutorals for more spicific use cases can be found `tutorial section of docs <https://gefest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html>`__.

Project Structure
=================

The latest stable release of GEFEST is on the `main branch <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/GEFEST/tree/main>`__.

The repository includes the following directories:

* Package `core <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/GEFEST/tree/main/gefest/core>`__  contains the main classes and scripts. It is the *core* of GEFEST framework;
* Package `cases <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/GEFEST/tree/main/cases>`__ includes several *how-to-use-cases* where you can start to discover how GEFEST works;
* All *unit and integration tests* can be observed in the `test <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/GEFEST/tree/main/test>`__ directory;
* The sources of the documentation are in the `docs <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/GEFEST/tree/main/docs>`__.
* Weights of pretrained DL models can be downloaded from `this repository <https://gitlab.actcognitive.org/itmo-nss-team/gefest-models>`__.

Cases and examples
==================
**Note**: To run the examples below, the old kernel gefest version, which can be installed on python 3.7 with: 

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/aimclub/GEFEST.git@4f9c34c449c0eb65d264476e5145f09b4839cd70

- `Experiments <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/GEFEST-paper-experiments>`__ with various real and synthetic cases
- `Case <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/rbc-traps-generative-design>`__ devoted to the red blood cell traps design.

Migrated examples can be found in cases folder of the main branch. 

Current R&D and future plans
============================

Currently, we are working on integration of new types of physical objects with consideration of their internal structure.\n

The major ongoing tasks:

* to integrate three dimensional physical objects
* to implement gradient based approaches for optimization of physical objects
