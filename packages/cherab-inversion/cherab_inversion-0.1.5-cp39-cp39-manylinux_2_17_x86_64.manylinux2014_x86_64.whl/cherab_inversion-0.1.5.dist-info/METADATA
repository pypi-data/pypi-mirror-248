CHERAB for Inversion, which is a package for the inversion technique of SVD, MFR, etc.
For more information, see the [documentation pages](https://cherab-inversion.readthedocs.io/).

Quick installation
-------------------
`mamba`/`conda` is recommended to install `cherab-inversion`.
```Shell

If you would like to develop `cherab-inversion`, it is much easier to create a conda environment after cloning repository.
```Shell
mamba env create -f environment.yaml
mamba activate cherab-inv-dev
python dev.py build
python dev.py install
```
Please follow the [development procedure](https://cherab-inversion.readthedocs.io/en/development/user/contribution.html).
