# Enasis Network Common Library

[![Validate](https://github.com/enasisnetwork/encommon/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/enasisnetwork/encommon/actions/workflows/build.yml)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/encommon/badge/?version=latest)](https://encommon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Common classes and functions used in various public and private projects for
[Enasis Network](https://github.com/enasisnetwork).

## Installing the package
```
pip install encommon
```

## Documentation
Documentation can be found on [Read the Docs](https://encommon.readthedocs.io).
If you venture into the sections below you will be able to use the `sphinx`
recipe to build the documention in `docs/html` for local consumption.

## Quick start for local development
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/enasisnetwork/encommon.git
```
Set up the Python virtual environments expected by the Makefile.
```
make -s venv-create
```

### Execute the linters and tests
The comprehensive approach is to use the `check` recipe. This will stop on any
failure that is encountered.
```
make -s check
```
However you can run the linters in a non-blocking mode.
```
make -s linters-pass
```
And finally run the various tests to validate the code and produce coverage
information found in the `htmlcov` folder in the root of the project.
```
make -s pytest
```

## Future features and subpackages

### `netdom` subpackage
This package will include class objects for handling network addresses and
other functions to assist with validating and normalizing domain names.

### `formats` subpackage
This package will include class objects to help with dealing with verious
formats of data. These formats will include Jinja2, CSV, and HTML.
