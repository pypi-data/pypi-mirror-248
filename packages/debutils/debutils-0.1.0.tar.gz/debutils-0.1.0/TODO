- Create email.py to facilitate sending emails via localhost (postfix server)
  - Complete impl of itpwriter, so it can send emails.
- Fix linter issues (hatch fmt)
- Better error handling
  - Put all custom error classes into an error.py, and replace any inheritance of
    Exception with DebutilsError
  - Top-level catcher that catches DebutilsError (or any subclasses) and prints a
    pretty message for the user instead of an ugly Python trace (exclude failed
    commands, we want a trace and everything)
- Type all functions, classes, everything (properly with typing module)
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
  - Generate Python documentation
  - Generate manpages (click-man)
    Don't add as a dependency (dev-dependency maybe, do they even exist?), create a Makefile to take care of that.
  - Some kind of wiki at docs/ (kind of like debmake-doc)
    - Link Codeberg wiki tab to web version of docs (pages on Salsa?, Codeberg pages?)
