The StrictDoc data model shall support connecting requirements using Parent and Child relations.

RATIONALE: >>>
Support of both Parent and Child relations allows to build typical requirements relations such as child-to-parent and less common relations when one document can have parent links to a parent document and child links to a child document (e.g., the so-called "compliance" or "tailoring matrix" documents may use this structure).

TITLE: SDoc markup language
STATEMENT: >>>
StrictDoc shall implement its own text markup language called S-Doc (strict-doc).
<<<
RATIONALE: >>>
The most commonly used Markdown format lacks the ability to store requirements metadata. While the RST syntax does allow for customization with directives to implement metadata extensions, its visual appearance contradicts other requirements of StrictDoc, such as the type-safety of the grammar and visual readability. Therefore, a markup language tailored specifically to the needs of the requirements tool provides direct control over the capabilities implemented in both the markup and the user interface.

STATEMENT: >>>
The StrictDoc's graph database shall maintain the requirement relations and their reverse relations as follows:

- For a Parent relation, the database shall calculate the reverse Child relation.
- For a Child relation, the database shall calculate the reverse Parent relation.
<<<
RATIONALE: >>>
The calculation of the reverse relations allows the user interface code to get and display both requirement's parent and child relations.
<<<
COMMENT: >>>
Example: If a child requirement REQ-002 has a parent requirement REQ-001, the graph database first reads the link ``REQ-002 -Parent> REQ-001``, then it creates a corresponding ``REQ-001 -Child> REQ-002`` on the go. Both relations can be queried as follows, in pseudocode:

.. code-block::

    get_parent_requirements(REQ-002) == [REQ-001]
    get_children_requirements(REQ-001) == [REQ-002]
