# compileMD

Markdown files are a popular format for technical project documentation, but as the amount of docu grows, the files can become long and difficult to manage. The solution to this problem is to break down the markdown file into smaller, more manageable seperate `.md` files and then compile them into a single file i.e., `README.md`. Hence, `compileMD` tries to solve this problem.

## How to use `compileMD` step by step?
1. Create a `md_docs` folder in your make project directory
2. Breakdown your README into granular markdown in ascending order, for e.g.
    - 00_intro.md
    - 01_installation.md
    - 02_body.md
    - 03_references.md
3. Run `compilemd`
