Scrape all Steam reviews from a specific profile

This script uses BeautifulSoup to do some very basic web-scraping and retrieve the reviews for a given user account. The profile must be set to public visibility.

* Free software: MIT license

Installation
============

::

    pip install archive-steam-reviews


Usage
=====

By default it will only retrieve the first page of reviews, and print to stdout. As the review page is sorted by most recently changed, usually the ``--all`` switch is only be needed for an initial dump of all existing reviews. If more than ten reviews are published and/or edited between running the script, the parameter is needed to get all changes.

When using ``--save``\ , each review will be stored in a text file named with the `Steam App ID <https://steamdb.info/apps/>`_ the review is for (unfortunately the game name itself is not available for scraping without an additional request). The file will have a `YAML frontmatter <https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/>`_ with some metadata (Steam URL, playtime, date of review, â€¦) and the review (converted to Markdown) as the post body. As such, it is ready for use in `Hugo <https://gohugo.io/>`_\ , similar static site generators or other purposes.
