# Time Formatting Tools
### Provides methods to manipulate and format various time-based objects into human-readable strings.

## Usage

```python
import datetime
import timefmt

now = datetime.datetime.now()

print("Now (short):", timefmt.dt.short(now))
print("Now (long):", timefmt.dt.long(now))

since_epoch = datetime.timedelta(seconds=now.timestamp())

print("Time since Jan. 1st, 1970 (short):", timefmt.td.short(since_epoch))
print("Time since Jan. 1st, 1970 (long):", timefmt.td.long(since_epoch))

# You can also automatically detect which type it is, like so
import random

random_choice = random.choice([now, since_epoch])

print("Unknown time format value (short):", timefmt.auto(random_choice))
print("Unknown time format value (long):", timefmt.auto(random_choice, long=True))
```
This prints the following:
```
Now (short): 11:12:12 AM
Now (long): 11:12:12 AM US Mountain Standard Time
Time since Jan. 1st, 1970 (short): 2817W 2D 18:12:12
Time since Jan. 1st, 1970 (long): 2817 weeks, 2 days, 18 hours, 12 minutes, and 12 seconds
Unknown time format value (short): 11:12:12 AM
Unknown time format value (long): 11:12:12 AM US Mountain Standard Time
```
