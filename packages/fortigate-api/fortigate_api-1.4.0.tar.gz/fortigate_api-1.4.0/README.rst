fortigate-api
=============

Python package to configure Fortigate (Fortios) devices using REST API and SSH.
With this package, you can modify objects in the Fortigate. The most commonly used `Objects`
are implemented in the `FortigateAPI` methods, but you can manipulate any other objects
that can be accessed through the REST API using the `Fortigate` methods.
Additionally, you can retrieve and modify the Fortigate configuration through `Ssh`.

Main features:

- REST API to create, delete, get, update objects. Move policy before, after other policy
- Session-based (user, password) and Token-based authentication
- SSH Netmiko connector to work with CLI commands
- Usage `Examples`

Fully documented on `Read the Docs`_.

Quickstart
==========

Install the package from pypi.org

.. code:: bash

    pip install fortigate-api

or from github.com repository

.. code:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/vladimirs-git/fortigate-api


FortigateAPI demonstration:

- Create address in the Fortigate,
- Get all addresses from the Fortigate,
- Get filtered address by name (unique identifier),
- Filter address by operator contains `=@`,
- Update address data in the Fortigate,
- Delete address from the Fortigate by name (unique identifier),
- Check for absence of address in the Fortigate,

.. code:: python

    import logging
    from pprint import pprint

    from fortigate_api import FortigateAPI

    logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

    HOST = "host"
    USERNAME = "username"
    PASSWORD = "password"

    fgt = FortigateAPI(host=HOST, username=USERNAME, password=PASSWORD)

    # Create address in the Fortigate
    data = {

    }
    response = fgt.address.create(data)
    print(f"address.create {response}")  # address.create <Response [200]>

    # Get all addresses from the Fortigate
    addresses = fgt.address.get()

    # Filter address by operator *contains* `=@`
    addresses = fgt.address.get(filter="subnet=@127.0")
    print(f"Filtered by `=@`, count={len(addresses)}")  # Filtered by `=@`, count=2

    # Update address data in the Fortigate
    data = dict(name="ADDRESS", subnet="127.0.0.255 255.255.255.255", color=6)
    response = fgt.address.update(uid="ADDRESS", data=data)
    print(f"address.update {response}")  # address.update <Response [200]>

    # Delete address from the Fortigate by name (unique identifier)
    response = fgt.address.delete(uid="ADDRESS")
    print(f"address.delete {response}")  # address.delete <Response [200]>

    # Check for absence of address in the Fortigate
    response = fgt.address.is_exist(uid="ADDRESS")
    print(f"address.is_exist {response}")  # address.is_exist False

    fgt.logout()
