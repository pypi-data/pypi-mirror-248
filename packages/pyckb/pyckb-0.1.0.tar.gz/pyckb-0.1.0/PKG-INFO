# Python SDK for CKB

Python CKB is an experimental project that aims to provide human-friendly interfaces for common CKB operations. Note that Python CKB is not a complete SDK, but only implements the CKB functions that I am interested in.

Features:

- No third-party dependencies. All code is visible.
- Incredibly simple.
