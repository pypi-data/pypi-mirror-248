    Improved a fix first implemented for :ticket:`3208` released in version
    0.9.8, where the registry of classes used internally by declarative could
    be subject to a race condition in the case where individual mapped classes
    are being garbage collected at the same time while new mapped classes are
    being constructed, as can happen in some test suite configurations or
    dynamic class creation environments.   In addition to the weakref check
    already added, the list of items being iterated is also copied first to
    avoid "list changed while iterating" errors.  Pull request courtesy Yilei
    Yang.
