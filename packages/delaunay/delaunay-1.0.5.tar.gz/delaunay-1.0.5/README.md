## What?

This is a pure python library for finding the
delaunay triangulation on given pointsets.
Maybe one day voronoi tessellation will be added, since its based on
the [quad-edge datastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quad-edge),
which makes finding the dual to each representations
easy.

## Installation && Usage

Either clone this repository or install via
pip:

`pip install delaunay`

An example usage looks like this:

```python
from random import seed, uniform
from delaunay.quadedge.mesh import Mesh
from delaunay.quadedge.point import Vertex
from delaunay.delaunay import delaunay

if __name__ == "__main__":

    seed(123123123)

    N = 44 # number of vertices

    vertices = [Vertex(uniform(0, 100), uniform(0, 100)) for v in range(N)]

    m = Mesh() # this object holds the edges and vertices

    m.loadVertices(vertices)

    end = N - 1

    delaunay(m, 0, end) # computes the triangulation

    # populates a list of [org, dest], values for further manipulation
    lines = []
    for qe in m.quadEdges:
        if qe.org is not None:
            lines += [[[qe.org.x, qe.dest.x], [qe.org.y, qe.dest.y]]]

    # plotting, for example:

    # import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # fig, ax = plt.subplots()

    # for line in lines:
    #     start, end = line

    #     ax.plot(start, end)

    # plt.show()

```

## How?

In their paper *'Primitives for the Manipulation
of General Subdivisions and the Computation of Voronoi Diagrams'*[0]
from 1985, L. Guibas & J. Stolfi propose a divide-and-conquer-algorithm
with all the rigor one can hope for.
The algorithm runs in O(n log(n)), which should be fine,
but for really huge sets R. Dwyers modification [1] of the
original algo from 1986 should provide a significant
improvement. For now i'll stick with the first one
mentioned, but later maybe this work will progress.

## Why?

In comparison with scipy[2] this library is
consirably more lightweight. Of course scipy's delaunay is
based on QHull[3], a library written in c, which means it
runs ~40 times faster than a python implementation [4].
