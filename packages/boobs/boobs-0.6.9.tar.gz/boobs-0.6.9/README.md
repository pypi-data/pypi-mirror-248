Boobs is a Telegram bot framework. It supports latest versions and features of the API. Incredibly fast and extraordinarily customizable, it gives you power to build the bot you always wanted.

## Install

```bash
pip install boobs
```

A stable version of Boobs can be installed using this command. Add `--pre` to the command to install a pre-release version.

## Features

Ever wanted to build a bot? You can do that in only 6 lines of code.

```python
from boobs import Bot, Message

bot = Bot("your-token")


@bot.on.message()
async def handler(m: Message) -> None:
    await m.answer("Hello world!")

bot.run_forever()
```

You can already [format text], [upload files], and make use of [an advanced state system] to craft complex interactions. And more features are expected to come! Check out the [examples].

## Customization

### Speed up event loop

```bash
pip install uvloop
```

Boobs supports uvloop, an event loop implementation which makes I/O [2-4x quicker](https://github.com/magicstack/uvloop#performance).

### Replace default JSON module

``` bash
pip install orjson
```

Swap out the module that is used under the hood to manipulate JSON and increase speed up to [5 times](https://github.com/ijl/orjson#performance).
