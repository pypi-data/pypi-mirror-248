# glwindow

A window library just like any other, except:

- native on windows
- SDL on linux and osx
- canvas in the browser

The same api, no matter the platform.

It also provides:

- QOI and QOA decoding
- OpenAL / Web Audio API

Batteries included, all of them.

To be added:

- video decoder (maybe mkv?)
- 3d object decoder (maybe gltf?)
- font parser (ttf?)

**(Work in Progress)**
