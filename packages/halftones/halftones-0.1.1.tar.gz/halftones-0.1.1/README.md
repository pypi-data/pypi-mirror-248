# Halftones Package

`halftones` is a Python package for generating halftone versions of images. It provides an easy-to-use interface for transforming images into their halftone representations.

## Example Output

![Halftone Image Example](images/halftone_image.png)

*Example of a halftone image generated by the `halftones` package.*


## Installation

Install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install halftones
```


## Example Usage
Here's a simple example to demonstrate how to use the halftones package:
```python
import halftones as ht
from PIL import Image

# Load your image (replace 'path/to/your/image.jpg' with your image file)
image = Image.open('path/to/your/image.jpg')

# Generate a halftone version of the image
image_color_info = ht.generate_halftone_image(image, display_flag=True, grid_width=5)

# The resulting 'image_color_info' contains information about the processed image
```
This example demonstrates loading an image using the PIL library, processing it with the halftones package, and retrieving the result.


## Features

The `halftones` package offers a range of functionalities for creating and manipulating halftone images. Here are some of the key features:
- **Halftone Pattern Generation**: Generate halftone patterns from images, a popular artistic effect that simulates continuous tone imagery through the use of dots.
- **Flexible Grid and Tile Configurations**: Create grids and tiles with user-specified angles and distances, offering flexibility in designing the halftone effect.
- **Command-Line Interface**: In addition to being a library, `halftones` can be used as a command-line tool, making it easy to process images directly from the terminal.
- **Customizable Halftone Effects**: Parameters for adjusting the halftone effect, such as alpha transparency and black channel threshold, allow for a wide range of artistic expressions.

These features make `halftones` a versatile tool for artists, designers, and anyone interested in image processing and halftone art.
