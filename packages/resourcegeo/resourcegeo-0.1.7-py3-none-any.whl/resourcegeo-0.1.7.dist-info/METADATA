# resourcegeo and utilities package

### Description
This package aims to solve data analysis-related tasks, and calculations with
numerical models


### Writing guidelines
This package is compliant at best extent possible with [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) 
and [PEP20](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/). A non-exhaustive list of these guidelines
is summarized in [Nik Tomazic](https://testdriven.io/blog/clean-code-python/) and includes:

PEP 8 naming conventions:

* Class names should be CamelCase (MyClass)
* Variable names should be snake_case and all lowercase (first_name)
* Function names should be snake_case and all lowercase (quick_sort())
* Constants should be snake_case and all uppercase (PI = 3.14)
* Modules should have short, snake_case names and all lowercase (numpy)
* Be consistent if using single quotes or double quotes

PEP 8 line formatting:

* Indent using 4 spaces (spaces are preferred over tabs)
* Lines should not be longer than 79 characters
* Avoid multiple statements on the same line
* Top-level function and class definitions are surrounded with two blank lines
* Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank line
* Imports should be on separate lines

PEP 8 whitespace:

* Avoid extra spaces within brackets or braces
* Avoid trailing whitespace anywhere
* Always surround binary operators with a single space on either side
* If operators with different priorities are used, consider adding whitespace around the operators with the lowest priority
* Avoid spaces around the = sign when used to indicate a keyword argument

PEP 8 comments:

* Comments should not contradict the code
* Comments should be complete sentences
* Comments should have a space after the # sign with the first word capitalized
* Multi-line comments used in functions (docstrings) should have a short single-line description followed by more text
