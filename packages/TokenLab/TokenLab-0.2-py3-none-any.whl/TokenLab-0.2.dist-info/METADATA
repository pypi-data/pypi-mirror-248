# TokenLab
 A python library for simulating token economies for Web3.0 and blockchain projects. Created by Stylianos Kampakis, PhD, CStat

## TokenLab principles
Tokenlab is a library for simulating token economies based on agent based models. It abides by the following principles:

1) Modularity: The different components can be merged as the user sees fit.

2) Explicitness: The assumptions behind the different modules are stated clearly, as well as any limitations.

3) Intermediate-level-of-abstraction: TokenLab is focused on simulating the actions of aggregate groups of agents (e.g. a certain user cohort), instead of individuals.

4) Focus on the economy: TokenLab's tools are focused on answering questions about a token economy, and performing things such as stress tests. 

5) Flexibility: TokenLab is designed in a way that it offers maximum flexibility to those who desire it. It can support logical flows, or arbitrary mechanisms within its simulations, for any kind of agent action.
