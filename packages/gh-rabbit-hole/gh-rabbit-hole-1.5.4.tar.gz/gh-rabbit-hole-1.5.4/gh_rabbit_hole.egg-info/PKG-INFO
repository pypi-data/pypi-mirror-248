AsyncioRabbitManager
====================

The ``AsyncioRabbitManager`` class provides an asynchronous interface
for connecting and interacting with RabbitMQ using Python and asyncio.
Designed for applications requiring reactive and non-blocking
processing, this class manages the connection to RabbitMQ, sending and
receiving messages, and declaring exchanges and queues, all
asynchronously.

Features
--------

-  **Asynchronous Connection:** Establishes non-blocking connections to
   RabbitMQ, allowing the rest of the application to continue executing
   while managing network operations in the background.
-  **Channel Management:** Opens and configures RabbitMQ channels to
   send and receive messages.
-  **Message Sending and Receiving:** Supports sending messages to
   queues or exchanges and configuring asynchronous callbacks for
   incoming message handling.
-  **Asyncio Integration:** Built around asyncio primitives for easy
   integration with other asynchronous operations and the event loop.
-  **Advanced Logging:** Utilizes a customizable logging system to
   monitor activities and quickly diagnose issues.

Usage
-----

Ideal for asyncio-based applications that require efficient and
asynchronous communication with RabbitMQ. Especially useful in contexts
where performance and responsiveness are critical, such as in
microservices, bots, or real-time data processing systems.

Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

   import logging
   from your_module import AsyncioRabbitManager  # Replace with the actual module name

   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

   rabbit_manager = AsyncioRabbitManager(
       amqp_url="your_amqp_url",
       sending_queue="your_sending_queue",
       listening_queue="your_listening_queue",
       sending_exchange="your_sending_exchange",
       logger=logger,
       on_message_callback=your_message_callback_function  # Replace with your callback
   )

Connecting to RabbitMQ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

   import asyncio

   async def main():
       await rabbit_manager.connect()

   asyncio.run(main())

Sending Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

   message = {"key": "value"}  # Your message content
   routing_key = "your_routing_key"  # Optional
   to_exchange = False  # Set to True if sending to an exchange

   rabbit_manager.send_message(message, routing_key, to_exchange)

Receiving Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Implement your message handling logic in a callback function:

.. code:: python

   async def message_handler(channel, method, properties, body):
       print("Received message:", body)

   # Set this as your callback
   rabbit_manager.on_message_callback = message_handler

Closing the Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

   async def close():
       await rabbit_manager.close_connection()

   asyncio.run(close())

Installation
------------

Ensure you have ``pika`` and ``asyncio`` installed:

.. code:: shell

   pip install pika asyncio
