> "Any sufficiently complicated Python program contains an ad-hoc, informally-specified 
> bug-ridden slow implementation of half of the Zope Component Architecture."


> **Warning**
> Due to PyPI refusing the submission of a package called "FLask-Plus", the package
> has been renamed (temporarily?) "Flask-Super". The Python package is still called
> `flask_plus`, though.

> (I known this sucks. Either way, it's temporary. Stay tuned.)
