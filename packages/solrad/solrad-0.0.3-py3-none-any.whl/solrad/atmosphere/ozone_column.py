computation and manipulation of the atmospheric ozone column of a site.


**CLIMATE DATA STORE**

"The Copernicus - Climate Data Store (CDS) is an online open and free service
that allows users to browse and access a wide range of climate datasets via a 
searchable catalogue. It also allows users to build their own applications,
maps and graphs."

1) CDS webpage at:
https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/home

2) More info about its API, at:
https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to

3) Useful tutorial on how to use the API, at
https://youtu.be/cVtiVTSVdlo
    

**NOTE:** As described by the links in 2) and 3), it is necessary to have a CDS 
account (and be currently logged in) account in order to be able to use
the API. Furtheremore, the user's key and the API website link should be 
stored in a place, recognisable by the system being used.

def compute_van_Heuklon_ozone(latitude, longitude, timestamp):
    """
    Returns the ozone contents in atm-cm for the given latitude/longitude and
    timestamp according to van Heuklon's Ozone model. The model is described in
    Van Heuklon, 'T. K. (1979). Estimating atmospheric ozone for solar radiation 
    models. Solar Energy, 22(1), 63-68'. This function uses numpy functions, 
    so you can pass arrays and it will return an array of results. The
    timestamp argument can be either an array/list or a single value. 
    If timestamp is a single value then this will be used for all lat/lon 
    values given. 
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    latitude : float or array-like of floats (npoints,)
        Site's latitude in degrees. Values must be between -90 and 90.
        
    longitude : float or array-like of floats (npoints,)
        Site's longitude in degrees. Values must be between -180 and 180.
    
    timestamp : pandas.Timestamp object or array-like of pandas.Timestamp objects float or array-like of floats (npoints,)
        The times for which the ozone is to be computed. It is strongly 
        recommend that the timestamp use an ISO 8601 format of yyyy-mm-dd.
        
    Returns
    -------
    result : float
        Ozone amount in atm-cm.

    Raises
    ------
    1) ValueError 
        "lan and lon arrays must be the same length"

    2) ValueError 
        "Timestamp must be the same length as lat and lon"
        
    Notes
    -----
    1) This function was directly taken from https://github.com/robintw/vanHOzone
       all credit goes to him. I copy-pasted the code rather than directly 
       downloading tthe pachage from pip as I wanted to add some very minor
       changes.
       
    2) The function supports array-like inputs for latitude, longitude
       and timestamp, as long as all 3 arguments are the same length. 
      
    3) Latitude of -90° corresponds to the geographic South pole, while a 
       latitude of 90° corresponds to the geographic North Pole.
      
    4) A negative longitude correspondes to a point west of the greenwhich 
       meridian, while a positive longitude means it is east of the greenwhich 
       meridian.

def get_CDS_ozone_column_data(path, year, month=None, file_format = "numpy"):
    
    """
    Connects to the Climate Data Store (CDS) through its API and downloads the 
    ozone-column data from the database in [1], for the requested time frame.
    A new folder (whose path is specified by the user) is then automatically
    created to store the downloaded files.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    path : path-str
        Path of the folder where one wishes to store the downloaded files.
    
    year : list of str
        List of years for which the ozone-column data is to be retieved. 
        The years must be of type str rather than int. 
        Eg.: year = ["2019", "2020", "2021"].
        
    month  : None or list of str
        If is None (default), all months for the selected years are retrieved.
        If not None, it must be list of months for which to retrieve the data.
        Said months must be of type str rather than int.

        Format in which the data is to be downloaded. 
        If 'NetCDF4', the data is downloaded in its original format and no changes are made to it.
        If 'numpy'  , the relevant water column data are downloaded, along with the latitude
        and longitude data, as numpy arrays. We also convert units from Dobson to atm-cm (see notes 
        for more info). Default is 'numpy'.

    -----
    1) Warning
       "WARNING: Local ozone column database lacks raw.npy data files for all 12 months of the year."
 
    Notes
    -----       
    1) res["raw_data"], res["raw_data_funcs"], res["avg_data"], res["avg_data_funcs"],
       res["precentile_data"] and res["precentile_data_funcs"] as many key-value pairs 
       as there are raw.npy files in the local ozone database.
    
    2) Latitude of -90° corresponds to the geographic South pole, while a 
       latitude of 90° corresponds to the geographic North Pole.
       
    3) A negative longitude correspondes to a point west of the greenwhich 
       meridian, while a positive longitude means it is east of the greenwhich 
       meridian.
