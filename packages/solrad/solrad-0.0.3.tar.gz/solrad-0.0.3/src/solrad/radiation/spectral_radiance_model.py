#%%                MODULE DESCRIPTION AND/OR INFO

"""
This module contains all functions related to the computation of the 
spatial and spectral distribution of direct and diffuse irradiance, also called
spectral radiance. This is accomplished by the combination of various models.
More specifically, one model for the spatial distribution of the diffuse component,
one model for the spatial distribution of the direct component and one model
for the spectral distribution of both components.
