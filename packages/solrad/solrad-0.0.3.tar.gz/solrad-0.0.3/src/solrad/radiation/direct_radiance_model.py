#%%                MODULE DESCRIPTION AND/OR INFO

"""
This module contains all functions related to the computation of the 
spatial distribution of direct/beam irradiance, also called direct/beam 
radiance. This is accomplished by modelling the direct irradiance as a 
point-like source of radiance, i.e, a dirac delta. However, since the the 
discretization of the sky does not have infinite resolution, I implement a
procedure whereby the irradiance of a point, gets proportionately redistributed 
to the nearest points which do appear in the regular grid.

    Compute direct sky radiance by modelling it as dirac delta function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Az : float or numpy.array of floats with shape (E,A,1)
        Grid of azimuth coordinates (in degrees) of the sky elements for which the 
        direct radiance is to be calculated. Its values should vary along axis 1.
        In any case, all values should be between 0 and 360 (inclusive). 
    
    El : float or numpy.array of floats with shape (E,A,1)
        Grid of elevation coordinates (in degrees) of the sky elements for which the
        direct radiance is to be calculated. Its values should vary along axis 0.
        In any case, all values should be between 0 and 90 (inclusive). 
       
    Gbn : numpy.array of floats with shape (1,1,T)  
       Direct normal irradiance [W/m^2] across time. Must be a
       non-negative array of numbers. 
       
    sun_apel : numpy.array of floats with shape (1,1,T) 
        Sun's apparent elevation (in degrees) across time. Values must lie 
        between 0 and 90 (inclusive).
        
    sun_az : numpy.array of floats with shape (1,1,T) 
        Suns's azimuth (in degrees) across time. Values must lie 
        between 0 and 360 (inclusive).
        
    Returns
