Jzazbz is a a color space designed for perceptual uniformity in high dynamic range (HDR) and wide color gamut (WCG)
applications. Conceptually it is similar to [CIELab](./lab.md), but claims the following improvements:

- Perceptual color difference is predicted by Euclidean distance.
- Perceptually uniform: MacAdam ellipses of just-noticeable-difference (JND) are more circular, and closer to the same
  sizes.
- Hue linearity: changing saturation or lightness has less shift in hue.

## Input/Output

/// warning | CSS Support
This color space is present the [Color HDR draft][css-color-hdr-1], but is not yet published in an official spec. If
this goes into an official, published spec, the ID and/or format is likely to change depending on the final decision on
format. We will likely keep the current format as a fallback for backward compatibility for some time.
///

As Jzazbz is not currently supported in the official CSS spec, only a draft, so the parsed input and string output
formats use the `#!css-color color()` function format using the custom name `#!css-color --jzazbz`.

```css-color
color(--jzazbz jz az bz / a)  // Color function
```

When manually creating a color via raw data or specifying a color space as a parameter in a function, the color
space name is always used:

```py
Color("jzazbz", [0, 0, 0], 1)
```

The string representation of the color object and the default string output use the
`#!css-color color(--jzazbz jz az bz / a)` form.

```py play
Color("jzazbz", [0.13438, 0.11789, 0.11188])
Color("jzazbz", [0.16937, 0.0312, 0.12308]).to_string()
```

## Registering

```py
from coloraide import Color as Base
from coloraide.spaces.jzazbz import Jzazbz

class Color(Base): ...

Color.register(Jzazbz())
```
