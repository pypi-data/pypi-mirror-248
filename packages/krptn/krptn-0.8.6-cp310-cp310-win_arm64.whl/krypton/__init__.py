A user authentication and access management system (IAM) with [Encryption at rest derived from credentials](https://www.krptn.dev/news/zero-knowledge/).

How we achieve this?

- All Data is encrypted (any data can be request by the developer to be secured)
- Only the appropriate users' credentials can unlock the cryptosystem (this protects you from server-side attacks)
