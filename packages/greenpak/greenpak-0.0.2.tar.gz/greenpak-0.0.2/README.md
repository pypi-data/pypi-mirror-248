import greenpak_driver as gp

print("Connecting.")
driver = gp.GreenPakDriver(port="COM17", control_code=0b0001)

print("Loading configuration.")
data = gp.load_greenpak_bits_file("my_design.txt)
gp.dump_hex(data)

print("Programming NVM.")
driver.program_nvm_pages(0, data)

print ("Reading NVM.")
data = driver.read_nvm_bytes(0, 256)
gp.dump_hex(data)

print("Reseting the devic.e")
driver.reset_device()
