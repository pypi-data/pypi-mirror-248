## multiphenics -- easy prototyping of multiphysics problems in FEniCS ##

**multiphenics** was a python library that aimed at providing tools in FEniCS for an easy prototyping of multiphysics problems on conforming meshes. In particular, it used to facilitate the definition of subdomain/boundary restricted variables and enabled the definition of the problem by means of a block structure.

**multiphenics** was developed by [Dr. Francesco Ballarin](https://www.francescoballarin.it), currently at [Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore](https://www.unicatt.it/), in collaboration with [Prof. Gianluigi Rozza](https://people.sissa.it/~grozza/)'s group at [SISSA mathLab](http://mathlab.sissa.it/). The financial support of the [AROMA-CFD ERC CoG project](https://people.sissa.it/~grozza/aroma-cfd/) was gratefully acknowledged.

New and existing users of **FEniCS** are encouraged to move to **FEniCSx** forthwith.
The [**multiphenicsx**](https://github.com/multiphenics/multiphenicsx) library, which is currently developed and maintained, targets **FEniCSx**, and effectively replaces **multiphenics**.

Like all core **FEniCS** components, **multiphenics** was freely available under the GNU LGPL, version 3.
