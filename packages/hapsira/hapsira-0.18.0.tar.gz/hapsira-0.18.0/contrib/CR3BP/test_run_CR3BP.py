Description
-----------
Contains a few sample orbit propagations to test the CR3BP library.

The orbits currently found in test file include:
    - L2 southern NRHO (9:2 NRHO of Lunar Gateway Station)
    - Distant Retrograde Orbit (DRO)
    - Butterfly Orbit
    - L2 Vertical Orbit

# -- Lunar Gateway Station Orbit - 9:2 NRHO

"""
The orbit is a Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) around the L2 Lagragian
point of the Earth-Moon system. The orbit presented here is a southern
sub-family of the L2-NRHO. This orbit is 9:2 resonant orbit currenly set
as the candidate orbit for the Lunar Gateway Station (LOP-G). Its called
9:2 resonant since a spacecraft would complete 9 orbits in the NRHO for
every 2 lunar month (slightly different from lunar orbit period).

The exact orbital elements presented here are from the auther's simulations.
The orbit states were obtained starting form guess solutions given in various
references. A few are provided below:

    Reference Trajectory - NASA, 2019
Ref: Strategies for Low-Thrust Transfer Design Based on Direct Collocation
    Techniques - Park, Howell and Folta

The NRHO are subfamily of the Halo orbits. The 'Near-Rectilinear' term comes
from the very elongated state of the orbit considering a regular Halo. Halo
orbits occur in all three co-linear equilibrum points L1,L2 and L3. They occur
in a pair of variants (nothern and southern) due to symmetry of CR3BP.

All other orbits in this section are computed from guess solutions available
in Grebow's Master and PhD thesis. He lists a quite detailed set of methods
to compute most of the major periodic orbits I have presented here. All of
them use differntial correction methods which are not yet implemented in this
library.
