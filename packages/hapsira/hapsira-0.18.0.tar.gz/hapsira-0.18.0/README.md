## Synopsis

`hapsira` is an open source ([MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)) pure Python library for interactive Astrodynamics and Orbital Mechanics, with a focus on ease of use, speed, and quick visualization. It provides a simple and intuitive API, and handles physical quantities with units. Its features include orbit propagation, solution of Lambert\'s problem, conversion between position and velocity vectors and classical orbital elements and orbit plotting, among others. It focuses on interplanetary applications, but can also be used to analyze artificial satellites in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO).

This project is a fork of the as of October 2023 unmaintained & archived [poliastro](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro) package.


## Installation

`hapsira` is supported on Linux, macOS and Windows on Python 3.8 to 3.11. Python 3.8 support will be dropped and Python 3.12 support will be added as soon as [numba 0.59 gets released](https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/9197).

Multiple installation methods are supported by `hapsira`, including:

## Migrating from `poliastro` to `hapsira`

`hapsira` is based on `poliastro main` as of the date of its archival, October 14 2023, [commit 1b01768c](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/commit/21fd7719e89a7d22b4eac63141a60a7f1b01768c). Therefore, `hapsira`'s initial release already includes a number of changes made since `poliastro`'s last release, `0.17.0`. Most notably, the plotter framework saw a redesign and is backwards incompatible, see [poliastro #1545](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pull/1545). For further details, see [changelog](https://github.com/pleiszenburg/hapsira/blob/main/docs/source/changelog.md).

## Frequently asked questions

* **What's up with the name?**

  "hapsira" is a shorthand for "[hapÃ«sira kozmike](https://sq.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hap%C3%ABsira_kozmike)", which is Albanian for "space". Why Albanian? Other than virtually every reasonable English (and German for that matter) package name related to this topic already taken, [Wag the Dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wag_the_Dog) is a film definitely worth watching.

* **Why a fork of poliastro?**

  See [here](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/issues/1640).

* **Is hapsira validated?**

  `hapsira` is a fork of `poliastro`, [which was validated](https://github.com/poliastro/validation/) against other [commonly used Astrodynamics software](https://hapsira.readthedocs.io/en/stable/related.html) such as GMAT and Orekit. Currently, `hapsira`'s results are matching those of `poliastro`.

* **Can I suggest new features for hapsira?**

  Sure, we encourage you to [open an issue](https://github.com/pleiszenburg/hapsira/issues) so we can discuss future feature additions!

* **What's the future of the project?**

  The best way to get an idea of the roadmap is to see the [milestones](https://github.com/pleiszenburg/hapsira/milestones) of the project.
