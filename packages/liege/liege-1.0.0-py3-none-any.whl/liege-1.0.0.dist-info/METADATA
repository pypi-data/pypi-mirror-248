Asynchronous Python client for the open datasets of Liège (Belgium).

## About

A python package with which you can retrieve data from the Open Data Platform of Liège via [their API][api]. This package was initially created to only retrieve parking data from the API, but the code base is made in such a way that it is easy to extend for other datasets from the same platform.

## Installation

```bash
pip install liege
```

## Datasets

You can read the following datasets with this package:

- [Disabled parking spaces / Stationnement PMR][disabled_parking] (952 locations)
- [Garages / Les parkings voitures hors voirie][garages] (26 locations)

| Variable | Type | Description |
| :------- | :--- | :---------- |
| `name` | string | The name of the garage |
| `capacity` | int | The capacity of the garage |
| `charging_stations` | int | The number of charging stations |
| `address` | string | The address of the garage |
| `municipality` | string | The municipality of the garage |
| `city` | string | The city of the garage |

## Example

```python
import asyncio

from liege import ODPLiege


async def main() -> None:
    """Show example on using the Open Data API client."""
    async with ODPLiege() as client:
        garages = await client.garages(limit=10)
        disabled_parkings = await client.disabled_parkings(limit=10)
        print(garages)
        print(disabled_parkings)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Use cases

[NIPKaart.nl][nipkaart]

A website that provides insight into where disabled parking spaces are, based
on data from users and municipalities. Operates mainly in the Netherlands, but
also has plans to process data from abroad.

## Contributing

This is an active open-source project. We are always open to people who want to
use the code or contribute to it.

We've set up a separate document for our
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thank you for being involved! :heart_eyes:

## Setting up development environment

The simplest way to begin is by utilizing the [Dev Container][devcontainer]
feature of Visual Studio Code or by opening a CodeSpace directly on GitHub.
By clicking the button below you immediately start a Dev Container in Visual Studio Code.

[![Open in Dev Containers][devcontainer-shield]][devcontainer]

This Python project relies on [Poetry][poetry] as its dependency manager,
providing comprehensive management and control over project dependencies.

You need at least:

- Python 3.11+
- [Poetry][poetry-install]

Install all packages, including all development requirements:

```bash
poetry install
```

Poetry creates by default an virtual environment where it installs all
necessary pip packages, to enter or exit the venv run the following commands:

```bash
poetry shell
exit
```

Setup the pre-commit check, you must run this inside the virtual environment:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

*Now you're all set to get started!*

As this repository uses the [pre-commit][pre-commit] framework, all changes
are linted and tested with each commit. You can run all checks and tests
manually, using the following command:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

To run just the Python tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```
