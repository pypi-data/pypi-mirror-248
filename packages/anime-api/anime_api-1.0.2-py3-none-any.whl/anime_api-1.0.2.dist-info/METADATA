The Anime API is a collection of wrappers for different types of free anime-related APIs. [Join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/PgQnuM3YnM).

## Why anime-api (and not others)?

There are several reasons why would you prefer using anime-api:

-   **Intuitive**: anime-api is designed to be intuitive. Supports autocompletion everywhere.
-   **Complete**: Every actively supported API has no feature left apart.
-   **Simple**: Get all the anime information you want with a single line of code.
-   **Legal**: I shouldn't need to say this, but all the APIs are legal. (no free streaming services/others)
-   **Actively supported**: Get new releases (with new API wrappers) every now and then.

## Installation

Using Poetry:

```
poetry add anime-api
```

Using pip:

```
pip install anime-api
```

## Documentation
